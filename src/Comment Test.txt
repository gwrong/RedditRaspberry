Shit, I misread the site and have been bumping up only every week... And at two months I'm basically at only 60kg....
Find a TDEE calculator and use that to figure out how many calories you're burning in a day. If you want to lose weight, eat 500 calories under your TDEE every day. Use MyFitnessPal to log and track your caloric intake. 

TDEE calculators are sometimes inaccurate, so you may have to adjust how many calories you eat. 
Coconut water.this keeps my appetite in check
Promise to keep track of what you are eating and drinking. For this, write everything down you eat on a **notebook** BEFORE you eat, and approximately how much you're eating. Write down the calories too if you can. Carry the pen and the notebook around with you to restaurant, work, etc. Never eat before writing it down.

At the end of each day, look at what you ate that day, and calculate calories per meal and per day.

Because you have to pause before eating and write it down physically, you get a second to think about it. It doesn't mean that you can't have a hamburger, but I think this will help you make better decisions and at least keep track of your food choices.

This can be temporary until you're used to eating better in general. But if you can't keep this habit up during that temporary time, then you need to ask yourself why you can't put in a minute to write down what you're eating before you eat.
I use Adidas Powerlift 2.0s. They work really well for squatting and cost $90 vs. the $199 for AdiPowers or $230 for Romaleos. I actually got mine on sale from Amazon for about $75.

Only downside is they will compress after a certain amount of weight, but this isn't really an issue for most people.
I feel your pain. After a hernia surgery with nothing to do besides TV and internet I unsuccessfully tried to hold back many a painful laugh.
Just lift heavy and eat a lot of meat and vegetables. Focus on the compound exercises such as bench press, squats, dips, pull ups, and dead lifts. These exercises release the most testosterone into your system, thus leading to further muscle tearing, resulting in muscle building. Don't overdue it though. You have to listen to your body and know what you can handle and when you should take a break. Over training is a serious thing. Do 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps of a heavy weight that leaves your muscles feeling pumped and worn. Watch your form and make sure you are maintaining adequate water and protein intake. Work all parts of your body, not just the ones you want to see improved. A lot of guys skip legs and then you see people with large upper bodies but chicken legs.  Consider joining a gym if you can afford it. Although it is kind of gimmicky, planet fitness is a great place to start for breaking into the hobby of muscle building. Remain consistent and push yourself harder and harder every week.
Alright thanks

It doesnt force you to, its there for your core to have something to push against. Its completely possible to keep your muscles relaxed while belted

I always do a cup of coffee mixed with almond milk or milk about 15 minutes before. The fat in the milk seems to give me a nice energy boost that lasts the whole workout.

I tried pre-workout before but can't stand the weird tingling feeling and all the chemicals. 
I think we're probably on the same page here, and just have a failure to communicate.

You referenced the cross-sectional area of the muscles, which I agree with, and if you read my other post in this thread, I said the exact same thing you did in your edit. The decreased leverage is linear, while the cross-sectional area is quadratic. Therefore, a larger person with similar proportioned dimensions will always be stronger than a smaller person.

But you jumped to lever length squared, and my brain went, "Woah, back up. That implies super skinny tall guys would be stronger than shorter, stockier guys." and I felt the undeniable urge to explain that in case there was any confusion. 

You're certainly not wrong, but the assumption of proportionality wasn't clear and the jump from "cross-sectional area determines the strength of your muscles, so strength comes from the length of your arms squared" made my brain hurt.


The Pendlay Do Wins are pretty solid squatting/Olympic Lifting shoes. They're about $120 on Amazon

You might like GZCLs intro template. You can find it on strengthcalc under powerlifting (I don't think it can be linked to). You might want to add a few more accessories for a more BB style experience.

Try front squat
My friend does 50lbs kettlebell swings for 50 or 60 reps. He says they make him fuck like a gorilla.
I hurt my leg playing soccer. Been wrapping it up in bondage for the last 2 months and it isn't making me stop. Worth giving a try. 
Huh, you're not helping 
The amount of protein bar elitism and bias in this thread is quite frankly hilarious haha. With that said, Quest or GTFO.
How long did you do stronglifts before switching?
&gt;  If we could find data of heavy short people and skinny tall people we could actually draw conclusions but that isnt the case.

Except what would this achieve? There's a reason you don't see people &gt;6' competing in the 132 weight class.

And if you're so against the "pseudo-science" in this thread, would you care to provide some real science?  
Wei Rui from Max Barbell are great weightlifting shoes for aroun $40-60. The black and blue ones have a wooden sole and are light as hell because of it. Great for the quick lifts and equally effective for squatting.

Learning to wear the world like a loose garment is like A1 in my recovery. Congrats on taking a step thattaway.

All three looked competition legal. You got less depth on the first lift than the second and third. 
At 6 feet tall and 185 lbs you are at a healthy weight. If you feel like your body composition is mostly made up of fat then do about 15 to 30 minutes of cardio before weight lifting. This will help you burn more fat. You have to get your heart rate up and keep it there for a considerable amount of time to burn fat. Watch your intake of fried foods and soda. Surround your meals with chicken, turkey, beef, vegetables and complex carbohydrates. Good luck!
I'm 5"8 male. Started at 175 pounds and very weak. Started looking good at like 155 I think. Took some time but as you get older time flies anyway. If you focus on minor victories, and always think of how far you have come you'll make it.

Only downside is they will compress after a certain amount of weight, but this isn't really an issue for most people.
Those numbers are going to go up so fast. I'm so excited for you big homie.
The one by me closes at 10 every night 
I want to get bigger.
Like. Way bigger.
I feel so scrawny.

5'6 142 pounds. I want to gain 20 pounds by 2016

Aaah I just wanna be swole.
Looks like nobody is gonna give an actual answer. Inhale at the top, pull it into your diaphragm, slowly release throughout the rep. Inhale when you're back to the top. 
What do you play? 
I started at my max for each lift and I've added 100lbs to bench, 200 lbs to squat and 200lbs to deadlift. It's hard.
I've been to the gym, and would eventually like to open my own one day. What's something that makes a difference for you, or that staff could do to really improve how you feel about the place?
Female here. Hit 82.5kg 5x5 last night. Was doing 30kg mid Jan. Believe it yo. 
Or you could just stop being weak? You shouldn't be justifying why you lift less than a smaller person, but figuring out what you need to fix.
Why do you think you breathe hard when you exercise?

Learning to wear the world like a loose garment is like A1 in my recovery. Congrats on taking a step thattaway.

All three looked competition legal. You got less depth on the first lift than the second and third. 
At 6 feet tall and 185 lbs you are at a healthy weight. If you feel like your body composition is mostly made up of fat then do about 15 to 30 minutes of cardio before weight lifting. This will help you burn more fat. You have to get your heart rate up and keep it there for a considerable amount of time to burn fat. Watch your intake of fried foods and soda. Surround your meals with chicken, turkey, beef, vegetables and complex carbohydrates. Good luck!
I'm 5"8 male. Started at 175 pounds and very weak. Started looking good at like 155 I think. Took some time but as you get older time flies anyway. If you focus on minor victories, and always think of how far you have come you'll make it.
lmao u lose weight by not being a fucking fatass /thread
When I started eating enough. You can put in all the work you want, but if you don't fuel yourself properly, you're just holding yourself back.
Shit, I misread the site and have been bumping up only every week... And at two months I'm basically at only 60kg....
Find a TDEE calculator and use that to figure out how many calories you're burning in a day. If you want to lose weight, eat 500 calories under your TDEE every day. Use MyFitnessPal to log and track your caloric intake. 

TDEE calculators are sometimes inaccurate, so you may have to adjust how many calories you eat.

Read the FAQ. Start a beginner program. There are several beginner programs listed in the wiki, all of which people have used to get solid "gainz". Following a well established program helps beginners to set a good strength foundation and progress quickly. If you aren't doing so already, I'd recommend you get MyFitnessPal and get in the habit of counting calories.

Yeah just dip the hips a bit more and certainly aim to drive with your heels! Still great form though
Currently looking like a schmuck trying to recreate the face/sound on my couch, BF staring at me from other end, took him a few seconds to realize we were on the same thread. 

Try keeping your mouth open while returning to upright, surprisingly easy to exhale while still flexing/clenching facial muscles, even while maintaining core tightness/breathing control. It's just Gunna make you frown like a badass. Think Samoan!
I absolutely love working out in the mornings! It is a phenomenal way to start the day.

I like to think "I've done more than most while they sleep than they will do their entire day".
as a conscious environmentalist? what is the trick to aggresively lose weight while maintaining a clear conscience?
I'm not discrediting what's given to me. All I've said is that I am not comfortable doing squats, deadlifts, and bench pressing. I said nothing to the effectiveness of them nor am I doubting that they work, but again as I've said many times, I'm not going to be doing those three exercises at the moment. 

It's great that you tell me no one gives two shits. I'm told to read the wiki/FAQ because I'm new yet Rule #1 says be respectful and civil. It isn't just my "bro" who told me that squat / bench isn't required. You're acting as if these three exercises have to be done or else you'll fail.

Squat your bodyweight until you feel comfortable going ATG (ass to grass). If it huts the way you do it, or you can't get to depth, then adjust your stance until it doesn't. Then add weight and do it the same way.
It's a great beginner's program, but people's insistence on sticking with it indefinitely is really, really irritating. Eventually, you have to graduate onto something else. It's extremely difficult to progress on your bench doing 1.5 workouts of 25 reps per week (too little volume, IMO), and it becomes nearly impossible to progress doing 5x5 or 3x5 of the same weight of squats **three times a week**. When you start squatting a decent amount, I don't think that's enough rest. 

It's not just because you're middle-aged. I'm in my 20s and I switched to a split because I wasn't getting results after a certain point. I deloaded several times because my form got shitty on squats, but I got stuck either at the same weight or 5 pounds heavier. It's even more annoying that Mehdi says that just because some people managed to get to a 3 plate squat doing just SL, that means you must be able to, as well. 

Mind you, I made great progress on it, and I'll recommend it to anyone who's starting out or returning from a hiatus, but some people treat it like a religion on this sub.
Texas method says you can try deadlifting every other week if you're not making progress, so I don't think it'd negatively effect your deadlift. Powercleans are pretty awesome so I don't see why not. Give it a go.
endurance=/=power
Your username combined with your knowledge of dick riding concerns me. 
Check out Texas Method, it seems up your alley. 

Also consider dropping to 3x5 to continue progressing. After doing 3x5, you can introduce a light squat day on Wednesday, which will also help you progress.

 No. You shouldnt be "noting" this. This isnt advice that is optional. If you wanna to see any decent gains in strength or aesthetics get a program. Seriously I cant explain how much im not joking. Programming is everything if you want to see results. Since you (clearly) dont know much, and with that must be inexperienced, I would suggest Starting Strength or (my personal favourite for beginners) Ice Cream Fitness 
i thought they were made out of wood..
http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/uberman-2/
Well if doctor oz says it has positive effects, who are we(non surgeons) to say otherwise? That man is a genius.
Trust me, you want to train arms.  Especially if aesthetics is your goal.
Big fan of these. I have wide feet (12EE in New Balance running shoes) so I really didn't want to cop Adidas or Nike without trying them on. Fortunately the Pendlay Do-Wins had enough comments calling them wide for me to roll the dice (because returns are a hassle).
Squat your bodyweight until you feel comfortable going ATG (ass to grass). If it huts the way you do it, or you can't get to depth, then adjust your stance until it doesn't. Then add weight and do it the same way.

I said nothing to the effectiveness of them nor am I doubting that they work, but again as I've said many times, I'm not going to be doing those three exercises at the moment. 

It's great that you tell me no one gives two shits. I'm told to read the wiki/FAQ because I'm new yet Rule #1 says be respectful and civil. It isn't just my "bro" who told me that squat / bench isn't required. You're acting as if these three exercises have to be done or else you'll fail.
