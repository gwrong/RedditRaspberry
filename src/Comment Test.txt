I am sitting at 250lbs and 36 waist right now aiming for a muscular 225. The one trait big benefit we have as tall guys is the ability to put on some muscle and the fact that our large bodies burn a lot more calories than a guy who is 5'8" every single day just moving amd walking. Let me know once you've watched the video I can help you come up with some workouts to do around the house without a gym membership. :) Talk to ya later!
Please do one of these on traps!!

He means on this sub, we get 5 more questions like yours, (how do I get started) every day. This bothers some users. The FAQ is there for a reason. My advice (also stated in the FAQ) would be to pick up Mark Rippetoe's book Starting Strength. Even if you don't do the program listed, it's a great foundation. I (a fairly lifter) am doing Phrak's Greyskull LP and love it. After you read SS, google that. Again, please consult the FAQ. Good luck on your fitness goals!
Rogue is **vastly** overpriced, that's for sure.
I'm assuming you're not British are you? 
If you are, I can offer a couple of places!

Oh also, I don't suppose you'd be open minded to building your own equipment?  I know sleds and prowlers are popularly homemade.
5lbs? The machines seem to only work around 5Kg every time. Not saying that the difference between 5lbs and 5Kg is that big but when doubling those numbers, it starts to be.  
Or are you talking about free weights?
That I can't tell you. I wear compression shorts all day, everyday. Good luck, man. Your struggle is real. Underwear shopping blows. 
the funny thing is I always unload the bar in the squat rack and then I'm off doing something else and someone will always walk over to me to ask me if I'm finished with the squat rack... I guess that's what happens when your gym is in rural Iowa 
I think the real question here is 'what's more important, hitting goal calories or goal protein intake'.

In short missing either every now and then isn't going to screw you majorly, but personally I'd be more than willing to go over by 200 calories if it meant another 50g of protein to hit a goal.
Honestly, go try it all, some things you might like, others you might not, or you could end up like me and want to do it all.  I ski and snowboard, rock climb, mountain bike, backpack, kayak, do yoga, weightlifting, and road bike.
i would check out wiki, or this site, which is great

Brought my weeks down to six days a drink
[Strong](http://strongapp.me) and probably others already do this?
There does seem to be a "go big of go home" attitude here, regarding routines. I get that a part of getting motivated is talking big game and pumping yourself up but combine that with the Internet's natural tendency to fight over which way is "right" (source? Source? SOURCE!?) it doesnt leave much room for people who are looking to take routines seriously, yet keeping it more light hearted/casual. Lots if people telling you you are doing it wrong if your progression is not up to par or just generally coming from a competitive lifting perspective (which isn't bad, not by any means).

Personally, the act of lifting is the purpose. yes I have a clear path of progression, but ultimately lifting is what I like to do and take joy in the act itself. This is something I've taken from buddhism/meditation, and I find it helps with motivation. Keeping the joy in the act of lifting rather than the results allows me to keep things fun and makes failure sting just a little bit less. This keeps me coming back instead of getting discouraged which, of course, leads to gains! Something to think about, of course your mileage may very, but this attitude (and zen/meditation) in general has helped me immensely in life. 
I go to my local boxing gym 2-3 times a week to supplement my routine. Lately I've been a bit lazy so I skip for a while and then hit the heavy bag and pads.
Wow, 2.4x bodyweight deadlift, very nice, congrats on the PR!

Back rounding wasn't too much of an issue at all, particularly considering you were trying to max out.

Hip height etc might benefit from re-evaluation though, but there are others who can better advise.
Perhaps even the powerlifting subreddit could advise more deeply.

I've always been a fan of Arnold's routine training opposing muscle sets on the same day. 
Do their normal boxer briefs fit well too? My under armor ones are good for a work out but way to hot for everyday
Bacteria can still grow in the fridge.
Decline hammer strength machine worked best for me while my shoulder was recovering. I could lift heavy and took almost all tension off my shoulder.  But it does depend on what is wrong with your shoulder exactly. 
Every time you work out, add 5 lbs to the weight you're lifting on each exercise. As a beginner it's doable for a few months if you do a reasonably low number of exercises. You're not a total beginner though so it may not be possible for you to keep up for a while. 
I'm almost there! 28, single, no major debt, and no kids!
It's a Basis Peak.  Overall I'm happy with the device.  It doesn't require any input, is comfortable, has HR monitoring, is waterproof etc...  But there are still a lot of software bugs.
This is great, I've been looking for something like this recently.  Do you have a good anatomy textbook reference if I want to learn about where muscles are and what they do without the specific exercise recommendations?
You say you've been lifting for years, I think that's ample time to gain steroids-like muscles. (I don't have anything against steroid-users, too. As long as they keep it safe)
