Ha, ok. "Robust studies? ROBUST STUDIES? WE DON'T NEED ROBUST STUDIES WHERE WE'RE GOING! AND YOU'RE GAY IF YOU WANT ROBUST STUDIES! GAAAYYYYYYY!" 

Have fun with your bro science. If you looked through the examine page, or my comment that I linked to, you'd see that the 2 largest studies showed no significant increase in power output. 

I'm open to creatine if it's proven to provide an edge. But the studies aren't large, and the largest ones don't support it. Its that simple. 
I love squats cause it's my biggest number, moving 3 plates just feels like such an accomplishment for me. 
Next week though.....

You could try cycling. It is non-load bearing exercise that is pretty gentle on your body (as long as you aren't sprinting!). Walking is also good because it is pretty gentle on your body as well. Walking is also something you can do at night (to avoid the whole sun flaring up your lupus thing). 

What you should be looking to do is non-weight (or load) bearing exercise. You wont put on much weight, but can tone up and avoid further bone damage.
ha I can't grow a beard jokes on you dom!
Sweet gains man!
[This](http://www.menshealth.com/mhlists/cms/uploads/1/classic_483x350_1.jpg) is the better one, the other will destroy your elbow joints
I also thought the back was too much rounded, also the elbows should be pointing downwards

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoZWgTrZLd8

I am no expert but have done a lot of research.
I use hair gel or hair paste pretty much every day. Should I rinse my hair before working out? 
As far as money is concerned, buy in bulk. 

It's alright to indulge sometimes. Just don't go crazy with it stuffing your face with all food in sight. Enjoy, but in moderation
I have a Mi Band, costed 20 dollars and seems pretty accurate when walking and counting. Also tracks sleep and lights up and vibrates on notifications, calls and alarms.
Oh yeah, well I clean and jerk!!
So I had a similar problem to you recently and made a simple fix which helped a lot...

It had to do with how I positioned my elbows when I squatted. Your elbows are pointing straight back for most of the lift, if you try to point them down to the floor more it will allow you to stay upright a bit more...

I learned that tip from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fmrKmJMQnw
This is the first time seeing him but I got this south park kind of humour vibe, pointing out the ridiculous in lifting culture with a touch of self depreciation.
Happened to me, but when I dropped the weight. Watch your breathing.
Keep it up man! Was able to hit the 1300 mark weighing 190 last summer. The stored potential you have is amazing!
I'm not clicking that link
You are:

* male

* college-age

* average height (~5'10")

* in the middle of the normal BMI range for your height

*  not on an established program (easily found in the sidebar)

* asking questions answered in the FAQ (see: "Does cardio impair muscle gains?")

* under the impression you're a special snowflake

Congratulations, your background is a perfect representation of the generic redditor!

Please take advantage of the links in the sidebar.


I know 100% deadlift is usually higher than squat. But I'm hitting 345x3 on squat and I can barely get 3 reps 315 on deadlift, what's the deal? 
Is there a certain weight I should stop bulking at? I'm 5'9 and currently weigh 160lbs, is there a point that I should stop and start cutting?
outstanding
Battle scars! Shit there not even that bad sometimes mine get real red, first time I got them I thought they were beginning to be strech marks lol
Had the same since whenever I started working out. No harm here.

I did get scared shitless the first time it happened though.
At least they can help you get a nice pelvic girdle or adonis belt or whatever. 

So can curls actually...
It's one thing to have a butt wink, it's another to have your entire lower back curving under.
Your body needs a certain amount of fat, while carbs are the bodies preferred fuel for working out.  Eat enough carbs to fuel your activities, and then eat enough fat to fill out your calories goal.
4oz(113g) of shredded chicken is ~29g of protein.

I'll eat about 16-20oz of chicken/day, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and whatever else to get to 155g.

It is what it is.

Feeling soreness in my lower back after I complete my 1x5 145 deadlift. Is this normal or is my form off? Sorry don't have video of me doing it.
They are constantly coming up with new chemicals that do the same things but aren't tested for.

That being said it doesn't really matter, you just don't cycle when you know you are getting tested. That's how all of professional sports already gets away with it.
You're invetiably going to lose some strength on a deficit when done over a longish time scale, try and get your sleep in check, shit sleep has an immediate effect and is something you can control.
Why is no one talking about his curls in the bathroom?  His arms looked massive, holy shit.  

I knew he was getting big but he must have had a MASSIVE pump.
3 minutes is fine, but if you're doing 5ish exercises every time, that will certainly add up.

Lots of guys will keep the rest intervals longer for the earlier, heavier sets (ex 3-5 minutes for heavy bench presses in the 1-8 rep range), and then shorten them down on the less important accessory lifts (ex. 60 seconds to 2 minutes on triceps extensions in the 10+ rep range.)

If you're having trouble with chin ups, I'd suggest 'leaving a couple in the tank' so to speak. If you can do 3 reps, and it takes you 5 minutes to recover, try doing 2 reps instead and and adding a couple more sets afterwards. It might only take 2-3 minute to recover from 2 reps.

Or do them at home if you can. Pavel Tsatsouline (a popular instructor) is a fan of what he calls 'greasing the groove' for chin ups. You basically do a couple chin ups every time you pass the chin up bar, multiple times a day.

No problem man. Have fun with it, and keep plugging away!
Their sauces are legit though.
Thank you! These links look as though they will be very helpful from the introductions.

I would be more worried about the ephedrine than the caffeine..
Combining anything amphetamine like with depression is probably going to worsen it.

Caffeine can decrease REM sleep, which might impact your depression. It could also trigger insomnia which can be hard to deal 
with.
This is awesome, congrats dude. 
You should try cross posting this to /r/gainit This would be great motivation for them over there. :)
I definitely enjoy the aspect of competition and showing who can handle it the best, but I also just like proving to myself I can do it. As a side effect, I just love super spicy shit.

Oh yeah you're absolutely right. But I was making the assumption that he was thinking of aesthetic purposes. Hence why I said aesthetic. 
Is this picture for real?  Could be a weird angle, but your arms look disproportionately huge.  Is that the case?  Got pics from different angles?
For stationary bicycles, is there a difference between recumbent bicycles and the non-recumbent ones? Does ones target specific muscles better?
Idk, I do know that it's tough as shit to hold on to the same amount of weight as a regular deadlift. 
You can only eat so much damn chicken until you venture off to other things
Here's a beast of a guy that runs and lifts. He puts in a lot of time at the gym but perhaps there is something you could glean from his workout: http://www.cameronhanes.com/2011/07/wanna-pile-on-25-lbs-of-muscle-for-the-mountains/

Having done some research into this, the vast majority of professional athletes and fitness models are enhanced. 

There is a lot of money involved in many sports, so athletes usually have access to high quality drugs, as well as experts who will help them pass.

As far as the mechanics of passing a drug test, a lot of it has to do with what the drug's half life. It is good to remember that these drugs have been highly researched and that experts can tell you a lot about how it works, why it works, and how long a particular dose will be in your system. There is one drug for instance which is only detectable for about 4 hours, so what people will do is take it before bed, because nobody is going to pull a drug test then.

The question is more "how does anyone ever get caught?". The answer to that usually involves getting the drugs from a bad source. It sometimes has to do with athlete being stupid and taking matters into their own hand. Or it might just be bad luck.

Jason Blaha has a lot of videos on how easy it is to pass drug tests. Apparently he used to help college athletes do it.

TLDR: Science, money, experts.
The thing is, it's better to be safe than sorry. Even if I've never had a knee injury I don't want to have any risk of injuring my knees from a PR attempt...
Yeah this is kind of what I figured...thanks anyways

How do you determine 1RM?

 before your working sets? after? on a day you rest that muscle group?

  I feel like going for 1RM will sap my strength and steal my precious gains.

I 
Men ran, the women watched Dr. Ugg's gruntshow to see what new all natural! herbal! Witch doctors don't want you to know! remedy they should be taking this week.
Yep that's what I got
A typical day for me:

Breakfast: huge bowl of really thick oatmeal and a banana.

Lunch: white rice with some kind of fish (frozen white fish is super cheap)

Afternoon snacks: soy milk, ginger cookies, maybe some bread

Dinner: veggies with rice or pasta, maybe some tofu.

Is there a certain weight I should stop bulking at? I'm 5'9 and currently weigh 160lbs, is there a point that I should stop and start cutting?
Random question. If I'm 279 lbs what would my protein intake be obviously I can't eat my body weight in protein and lose weight so at what limit do I stop protein intake. 
I agree with this,i need those rest days to progress,how about when you work out with your buds on the off days just focus on a few light sets to practice form and mobility exercises,your bros will wonder why your gainz are killing theirs when all you are doing is pause squatting the bar :D
Creatine causes severe health defects. Nice try, mom.

How do you determine 1RM?

 before your working sets? after? on a day you rest that muscle group?

  I feel like going for 1RM will sap my strength and steal my precious gains.

Edit: I know there's calculators for scaling up from 2-10RM but I don't think they are entirely accurate
Men ran, the women watched Dr. Ugg's gruntshow to see what new all natural! herbal! Witch doctors don't want you to know! remedy they should be taking this week.
Yep that's what I got
A typical day for me:

Breakfast: huge bowl of really thick oatmeal and a banana.

Lunch: white rice with some kind of fish (frozen white fish is super cheap)

Afternoon snacks: soy milk, ginger cookies, maybe some bread

Dinner: veggies with rice or pasta, maybe some tofu.
Oh yeah you're absolutely right. But I was making the assumption that he was thinking of aesthetic purposes. Hence why I said aesthetic. 
Is this picture for real?  Could be a weird angle, but your arms look disproportionately huge.  Is that the case?  Got pics from different angles?
For stationary bicycles, is there a difference between recumbent bicycles and the non-recumbent ones? Does ones target specific muscles better?
Idk, I do know that it's tough as shit to hold on to the same amount of weight as a regular deadlift. 
You can only eat so much damn chicken until you venture off to other things
Here's a beast of a guy that runs and lifts. He puts in a lot of time at the gym but perhaps there is something you could glean from his workout: http://www.cameronhanes.com/2011/07/wanna-pile-on-25-lbs-of-muscle-for-the-mountains/
I would be more worried about the ephedrine than the caffeine..
Combining anything amphetamine like with depression is probably going to worsen it.

Caffeine can decrease REM sleep, which might impact your depression. It could also trigger insomnia which can be hard to deal 
with.
This is awesome, congrats dude. 
You should try cross posting this to /r/gainit This would be great motivation for them over there. :)
I definitely enjoy the aspect of competition and showing who can handle it the best, but I also just like proving to myself I can do it. As a side effect, I just love super spicy shit.
Feeling soreness in my lower back after I complete my 1x5 145 deadlift. Is this normal or is my form off? Sorry don't have video of me doing it.
They are constantly coming up with new chemicals that do the same things but aren't tested for.

That being said it doesn't really matter, you just don't cycle when you know you are getting tested. That's how all of professional sports already gets away with it.
You're invetiably going to lose some strength on a deficit when done over a longish time scale, try and get your sleep in check, shit sleep has an immediate effect and is something you can control.
Why is no one talking about his curls in the bathroom?  His arms looked massive, holy shit.  

I knew he was getting big but he must have had a MASSIVE pump.
3 minutes is fine, but if you're doing 5ish exercises every time, that will certainly add up.

Lots of guys will keep the rest intervals longer for the earlier, heavier sets (ex 3-5 minutes for heavy bench presses in the 1-8 rep range), and then shorten them down on the less important accessory lifts (ex. 60 seconds to 2 minutes on triceps extensions in the 10+ rep range.)

If you're having trouble with chin ups, I'd suggest 'leaving a couple in the tank' so to speak. If you can do 3 reps, and it takes you 5 minutes to recover, try doing 2 reps instead and and adding a couple more sets afterwards. It might only take 2-3 minute to recover from 2 reps.

Or do them at home if you can. Pavel Tsatsouline (a popular instructor) is a fan of what he calls 'greasing the groove' for chin ups. You basically do a couple chin ups every time you pass the chin up bar, multiple times a day.

No problem man. Have fun with it, and keep plugging away!
Thanks for the tip! Will do that right away! :)
The school has to be able to provide top put with a chart for that stuff. Just ask!
One thing I forgot to address was your question about which size to buy.  I prefer the longer ones as I find them more versatile since you don't have to be as precise on keeping the roller focused on one area.  The main reason (in my opinion) to purchase a smaller roller (~12") is those are easy to pack in a suitcase if you travel.  Lots of marathoners use foam rollers and devices like "The Stick" and having something you can easily throw in a carry-on bag is really handy.  If you're going to be using a foam roller at home, I suggest buying a the longer ones.
Pretty sure they legally have to tell you...
This question may seem a tad blunt so sorry in advance but what are your teeth like now?
Random question. If I'm 279 lbs what would my protein intake be obviously I can't eat my body weight in protein and lose weight so at what limit do I stop protein intake. 
I agree with this,i need those rest days to progress,how about when you work out with your buds on the off days just focus on a few light sets to practice form and mobility exercises,your bros will wonder why your gainz are killing theirs when all you are doing is pause squatting the bar :D
Creatine causes severe health defects. Nice try, mom. 
Having done some research into this, the vast majority of professional athletes and fitness models are enhanced. 

There is a lot of money involved in many sports, so athletes usually have access to high quality drugs, as well as experts who will help them pass. As far as why drug use is so high, well that has a lot to do with game theory.

As far as the mechanics of passing a drug test, a lot of it has to do with what the drug's half life. It is good to remember that these drugs have been highly researched and that experts can tell you a lot about how it works, why it works, and how long a particular dose will be in your system. There is one drug for instance which is only detectable for about 4 hours, so what people will do is take it before bed, because nobody is going to pull a drug test then.

The question is more "how does anyone ever get caught?". The answer to that usually involves getting the drugs from a bad source. It sometimes has to do with athlete being stupid and taking matters into their own hand. Or it might just be bad luck.

Jason Blaha has a lot of videos on how easy it is to pass drug tests. Apparently he used to help college athletes do it.

TLDR: Science, money, experts.
The thing is, it's better to be safe than sorry. Even if I've never had a knee injury I don't want to have any risk of injuring my knees from a PR attempt...
Yeah this is kind of what I figured...thanks anyways

Just worry about being consistent, and adjust your assumptions until your results match your predictions. That will work well unless your diet changes dramatically. 
It actually went really well. The numbness and tingling are gone, but i havnet been cleared to resume any lifting yet, so i cant relate how its improved in that aspect. And I did develop bursitis about a week ago, but theres no pain only a bit of swelling. I have the same issue with my left elbow also, and considering how well the first surgery went, i won't hesitate to have it again.

Restaurant nutritional info is known to be notoriously inaccurate as it is, and I would expect cafeterias to be even more so. I'm not saying don't use their info, I just wouldn't personally expect it to be any more accurate than my own guesstimate, maybe less so.

Thursday isn't shown. We workout 4 days a week, and I usually go the gym friday. Also the set x rep count are sometimes different. Sometimes we do 8x4, 6x4, 10x3, and 5x5. 
trademark is one word hedonist
Bench monkey just sounds racist.
Fuck, I just ordered lifting shoes last week. My friends will never let me live this one down. Plus I fit into the whole obsession with leg day thing too.
You might have to ask them specifically. They aren't allowed to serve food without knowing what is in it. There are fed regulations.
D-did Dom actually... squat? 

In all seriousness, his videos are always great.
