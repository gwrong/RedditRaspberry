Thanks! I'm really happy for you as well. I know how much it sucks to be overweight and how much better you must feel. So mad congratulations.
Fuck off homoYou're not overtraining, under recovering perhaps, but it takes an insane amount of volume and frequency to overtrain.http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rpixh/what_is_overtraining/c47mypi

Are you like /u/silverhydra ?Yeah but that's before you take tooth retention into account I'm super late to this party, I hope somebody sees this.  

I was kind of under the impression that mixed grip deadlifts are a easier move than traditional grip deadlifts. Recently, I've had some trouble hitting my sets (1x5 @ 300 lbs; bw 184, 6'1")and I switched to mixed grip and it was AMAZING.

Blew through my plateau easily. But my stupid question is this. Should I wait to use mixed grip? I've been getting the impression I'm supposed to stick with traditional grip. Somebody on this sub once implied switching may end up hurting your noob gains.

Tell me friends, am I just being a stupid worrywart? Or should I try to stick with regular deads as long as possible.When you got dem muscles you'll get your heat backFuck the bench press. Why do Canadians always factor in the windchill?NoFirst time squatting today. Do I position my arms first then get under the bar or vice versa? I did the former and it felt uncomfortable. Maybe my width wasn't wide enough or too wide?Ahh that makes sense. Yeah I guess the more you have the easier it is to lose it since all that material's helping you burn anyway. Your metabolism must have been just chuggin'.  Good for you!It was. Then I quit running. High Intensity Interval Training. Probably Google that, I don't have any good resources on it for running anymore. Generally just did hill springs and 30s Sprint, 60s jog. Shit like thatI'm not really sure from your post where you're at currently.  How many miles do you run a week?  A fast mile time is a good sign, but it's really all about volume.

Also, /r/running M/16/5'5/115lbs http://imgur.com/EcAVC9C

Bench:135x1

Squat:155x5

Deadlift:170x5

Been lifting for 3 months, don't even know if it shows. Any advice for a beginner would be appreciated. So far I've been doing SL5x5
But how exactly do you go from skinnyfat to lean?I like this, wouldn't there also be a possibility of passing out if you are lifting heavy with your head angled down like that?Yes absolutely.  Also prioritize getting a rack in your life!  They are crucialMaybe you get used to it. I am 180 cm on 127.6 lbs and I pretty much do not care about winter. 

Edit: OMG, I talk only about me. Congrats to your loss!I got in a mildly heated argument with someone very close to me about stretching before working out. This person told me that stretching before running/lifting is bad for you. So for the love of God how dumb is it to not stretch before you workout? I get my other needed vitamins and nutrients from other sources, and lots of people do it, GOMAD is a good example. Do you have any articles about it? And all well, I need my gainz.why?The fat slows down sugar absorption, lowering your blood sugar and slowing down insulin spikes.  Personally, I like 2%Thank you very much.  
I probably should have been a little clearer about my goals. I do want to balance my upper and lower body, but losing weight is my priority. So for the time being I'm alright with progressing very slowly. I just want to focus whatever progress I'm able to make on my upper body, while taking the stress off my legs so that I can run without it feeling like I'm running through water.

So you would suggest an upper/lower split, but with only one lower body day? E.g. [Westside for skinny bastards](https://www.defrancostraining.com/articles/38-articles/65-westside-for-skinny-bastards-part3.html) without the "dynamic effort lower body" day?I widened my feet and wasn't as straight up as in the videos this morning and it felt MUCH better. Thanks. My gf squats 185 1rm and has a gap. You don't have to starve yourself, you just need genetics.I saw this one a while ago, so my memory is hazy.  In some respects they are right - if you don't have the right genetics, you'll never be Arnold. That said, you can transform your body to something amazing.

As to supplements, yeah, they are mostly garbage. Eat the proper amount, get the proper vitamins/minerals, and you are golden. 

Creatine is about the best (only) supplement available on the market that works and it's effects aren't really 'wow' inducing.  Doesn't matter Here's his thread about it: http://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/2ee1qb/10_month_transformation/Ah, shin splints. My old nemesis. Had them in both legs a few years back. I would recommend 1) investing in proper running shoes. You would be amazed at the difference a good shoe/insole can make. This means going to a running store. 2) stretching your calf out before you run and doing heel dips and toe raises on the edge of a step afterward. 3) ice the sore spots after a workout. 

If the pain gets really bad to the point where you can't run at all you're gonna have to shut it down and probably see a doctor. Physical therapy may be in the cards, or you may just require rest. Either way, listen to your body and if the pain gets too bad you need to stop. Go on the diet with her. But let's face it, diets don't work. She needs a lifestyle change. If she's overeating there has to be a reason behind that. If you are worried about being unbalanced just switch out which hand is over and which is under.you dont have any mass.  you are overeating.  Just keep doing SL, you will catch up eventually

you dont need to start cutting, just start eating slightly lessBody weight is around the 185 mark. Lifts are: dead lift 400, squat 275, bench 205 regularly. My bench upsets me but I can dumbbell bench 100s so there's that. Have you actually seen a picture of Penn and Teller? Would you want to look like either one of them? Now why would you take fitness advice from them? Yeah, didn't think so. Keep an eye on your thyroid levels.  Not just TSH and free-T4, check free-T3 also.  Body fat modulates free-T3 significantly, and this typically can crash quite hard after a large amount of weight loss.  Its a good idea to monitor periodically for a while, and treat if necessary.  It will make maintenance much easier if you keep that in check.  Good job on the weight loss!Drink fluids, preferably low sugar and little caffeine(diuretics that makes you pee and then you lose water). Milk and green tea should be fine. They are actually water with other things dissolved in. So just drink more of them.Yes, hot people should definitely get naked. I don't know.  To me, when I hear someone say "aesthetic", it's just another way of saying I want to get ripped and never put on any bodyfat in the process.  Most people can't do that without drugs &amp; trying is a waste of time &amp; effort.  Better to accept the bulk/cut mentality &amp; not get hung up on adding some bodyfat while bulking.You've forgotten: when you're skinny, it's so easy to unfold and undo the wrinkles.Ironically you want to wear underwear less when you get in shape. Hi there, another fat guy reporting in. I play football for my college, and a lot of the running we do are on hard surfaces, so you can imagine the shin splints my ass gets. There is a stretch I suggest you try where you lean your back against a wall and force your toes up as high as you can so that you're just on your heels. That along with rolling out your shins with any type of foam roller or PVC pipe are the only 2 treatments that I can think of. 

The only REAL way to get rid of them however is to take time off of them. Biking is a great alternative until they heal up, as is swimming. 

Take this from one fat guy to another, shin splints ain't no joke.

I prefer to get my micro and macro nutrients from food sources more than a pill or a supplement (but that's why it has that name).  

There is a certain degree of genetics (how much it plays I can not accurately say) that play into athleticism but if I recall correctly, they were making more of a statement against BMI more than anything.Thanks for the answer. 

Yes, calf extensions using the seated leg press  machine (we only have [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VF6wqIoOxtI/Trl-F6m-XJI/AAAAAAAAAFs/xFeUtzn3I-s/s1600/Standing+Calf+Raise+2286.jpg) one calf machine and i don't like it because it hurts my bony shoulders). Perhaps I should try some using the smith machine.Thank you so much For some people it's like craxk. They take one bite and can't stop. Ever.Thats not crossfit thats two Idiots sharing a barbell. Until you look and lift like the top crossfit athletes dont shit on it. Anyone can take a perfectly safe and effective exercise and fuck it up to potentially hurt themselves. 
Hmm, that might be the case. Thanks for the input, dude! (:What in the almighty fuckI've followed scooby's workshop for years. It's this 50-yr-old guy with great physique and a no-BS sense of logic. Check out his website (it's all free, and it's all good).
For your 'skinny-fat' specific question, start here: http://scoobysworkshop.com/gain-muscle-lose-fat/I'm new to supplementation so I was wondering if I should take BCAA and protein on the days I do cardio? And when should I? Like before after or during? Thanks!single leg...deadlifts?What do you mean by good nutrition? Do you mean just eating under your TDEE?After our kids were born I got in the best shape of my life, and I think seeing my progress really got my wife motivated too.

So, Like everyone else said... Get on a diet tooDrinking water before eating, instead of with the meal, will help make you feel full faster, making it easier to reduce calories. If you are trying to lose weight then yeah plane water is great.My guess is - he's Dutch. All my Dutch recipes are in deciliters. Even as a Canadian (and metric system user) it still throws me for a loop.Today i did my one rep max of 2 plates in the squat rack. This "personal trainer" guy looked at my 1 rep and shook his head. My friend told me this when we where driving home. 

Funny thing is: HE FUCKING DOES SQUATS IN THE FUCKING SMITH MACHINE. FUCK HIM. He's JUST PUSHING WEIGHT UP AND DOWN. Working out and building muscle will take care of the "skinny" part. Practicing good nutrition will take care of the "fat" part. &gt;there's got to be something

Not unless you can change your genetics. You'll need to lose more fat to lose fat on your legs, and that's just the way it is for you.Right now I'm just focusing on avoiding fast food restaurants as well as foods that are high in calories. Reading the labels of all the foods you consume is also a good start!I could probably get in a full-body workout on Saturdays plus a few runs throughout the week in the mornings. Just a little nervous about losing myself physically during that time. Thanks!I know it's late, and this might violate rule 5 I think. But what are these marks near my collar bone. They appeared a little bit after I started lifting and they get redder and redder each time I lift. The picture kinda washes them out but here's some. Also I don't do power cleans or front squats so the bar is never racked here. 

http://i.imgur.com/KSnuyDi.jpgI'm a noob is myself(again!). Working out /building a lifestyle of fitness for me has been like tipping over a drink machine. It takes a couple rocks to finally tip the thing over. Quitting smoking was the same way; took me years and years of stops and starts. Understanding that I'm not perfect and falling in love with the process rather than the results helps me(but it's difficult and I have to keep remind myself, I'm pretty weak mentally). 


If you're into corny sayings; here's on that helps me. "The only workout you regret, is the one you didn't do."OR call it carb back loading and just go extra low carbs on the days you don't work out. I've topped out at working about 75 hours per week. If you can try to fit in one full body workout per week to avoid losing gains. That's about as good as it gets.He is **REALLY** good at squats.

He is really good at deadlifts.

He has bad shoulders.

I may lurk too much...you ever use a hand grinder and try to break a world record for grinding beans? it's funRunning puts about 7X the force on your knees (and thus your shin where the quadriceps tendon attaches) that walking does. You might need to slow your running speed down until your body is more used to the punishment. Keep it up though, I am in the same boat (5'10" and heavier than you) and a slow progression has thus far kept my shins happy. I lost a bunch and the first Chicago winter I went through was unbearable. You adjust and get acclimated.Learn to cook. That's probably the single action you can take which will have an immediate and lasting impact on her success. Throw out all of the shit in your kitchen and replace it with whole foods and snacks like Greek yogurt and beef jerky. Cook healthy Meals with a decent macro balance like chicken breast with sweet potatoes or shredded chicken stuffed avocado. the body is too light for me, i do enjoy the nuances of flavors though. i didnt watch the whole thing. i think they are stretching for something. 

everyone can get ripped and lean. sure there are a couple exceptions for handicaps and super rare disabilities. but that ectomorph stuff is bullshit.

they are right that quick fixes dont work, ie most supplements and pretty much everything fitness related you see marketed on tv.

they are right that no matter how much must of us work we wont be fitness models. but we can get a body damn close. we just will have some symmetry issues or we wont be the right race, height, whatever. but we can all get amazing bodies if we want to make the sacrifices, and i dont think those sacrifices vary nearly as much as they are saying.Agree with everything you said, I think that's a fair response given the posts on here. Just wanted to clarify for others in case they weren't aware that it is possible, although quite unlikely. You can put a back pack on the kidHere are the basics (Scooby's workshop): http://scoobysworkshop.com/bodybuilding-nutrition-made-simple/

Oy. Reminds me of that one time I saw my sister's friend try to jump out of our swingset with a backflip but then her arm got caught in the swing's chain...  O_oTDEE?I actually feel colder the more weight I gain, but I have an excema skin type so it's a lot more sensitive than others.I don't think you've read the [sticky](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started) then.I did read the FAQ and saw nothing that pertained to my situation on it.I think it's important to be realistic about why your exercising. For me, it's an important outlet for daily frustration, a way to keep my weight in check and also a chance for me to not be around people for a bit. 

I see lots of people who go into fitness with unsustainable routines or through programs that cost an arm and a leg to fund. I'm not saying that those aren't valuable and enjoyable at the time to do, but they aren't something that can be kept up for decades. 

I guess it's like cooking. While it is fun to have a bit of flair now and again, it's important to understand the basics. For cooking, you need to know what spices do what, what oils to use and what temperatures to cook at. And for exercise, you need to know what you enjoy and what you can do sustainably. If you can understand these factors intellectually, you will be more likely to physically maintain a routine. Over time, your routine might develop with your lifestyle or the intensity or regularity might chance. But the same fundamental basics will always apply. Are you enjoying it and can it be done again and again and again?

Dollar stores should have them.  It's different.If all you've got is 5th grade science projects to back up claims you should stick to trolling ELI5 bruh.

How about you explain the anecdotal evidence in this thread of people dropping weight and feeling warmer?Dude. No. Try it. Can't go wrong with double pants.I used to have to turn my heating blanket to 10 and wrap myself in it. My always-cold girlfriend wanted it at 5 and would usually discard it halfway through the night. It gets better eventually. You know, in the spring.No problem What works best is different for everyone. I saw a post a while back that inspired me to use this technique: when I'm going for a PR and psyching myself up before starting the set I think to myself "this is it, you have these next 30 seconds to push through and do it, and if I fail I have to live with failing this for X amount of time" (ie until my next PR attempt whether it's next session or next week or whatever).

Basically telling myself 30 seconds of work and I have to live with the outcome for days, lets get this shit done so I don't have failure lingering over my head.thank youBack is rounding.  Drop your hips lower and try to straighten your back.I've started using unsweetened vanilla coconut milk instead of milk, has a lot of healthy fats, some vitamins and minerals, and has no sugar or sodium.I have no idea what any of that means.Keep in mind that fitness is a life long commitment. You'll have good days and bad days (hell, bad weeks or months too). 

But keep doing what you know is right for you and you'll keep making progress. 

I have a 6 month old daughter. I've had to cut WAY back on my volume and intensity in the gym due to lack of sleep. But I know that this is temporary. Before I know it, she'll be sleeping more, so I'll be able to recover better and start hitting it hard again. 

Try not to let a couple bad days get you down. Wow, this is so wrong. Never give advice again.

Intermittent fasting is a great way for some people to control their hunger and cravings, it has also been shown to help your body with insulin sensitivity and raise natural test levels.

Cheat days, or, refeeds, definitely can help, especially if you are cutting on a low carb diet. 

When you restrict carbs and calories for long enough your body starts to have decreased leptin production. A refeed can help boost the production of leptin back to normal levels, thus firing up your body's fat loss again.TDEE is the amount calories your body burns in a 24 hour period, sleeping, working, exercising, playing and even digesting food.
  
See us humans have a very simple science behind us so bare with me as I blow your mind.
  
Want to gain weight? Eat above TDEE.
  
Want to lose weight? eat below TDEE.
  
Of course diet isn't the only thing, since I'm assuming you've never done or progressed far into strength training I suggest you start doing compound lifts to gain muscle since you don't wanna be fat right?Overhead squats are completely useless outside of a Crossfit comp. Your drinking problem. The arms detached from the torso but still on the bar.

*shudders*What weaknesses do the programs have? And can they be easily fixed?dumbbell deadlifts and a goblet squat? Sathanas didnt approve his 3rd dlI have never heard of creatine causing baldness.....* Stay at a healthy amount of body fat
* Get your hormone profiles checked out
* Get a Dexa Scan to measure bone density and muscle mass. 
* Strength Train

Strength training will provide you a life long base to build bone density, increase muscle mass, increased endurance of cardiovascular and muscular systems.  It will also develop joint stability and over all balance.

There are even masters 60+ weight classes in most powerlifting federations and a 70+ year old lifter is not uncommon at all.Waffles, eggs, milk, protein shakes, yogurt, spinach, and tilapia.Look, you're arguing that fat isn't an insulator. That is as ridiculous as arguing gravity doesn't exist.

Now if the silver bullet of your "argument" is why do some people feel warmer then I have to remind you that poor circulation is quite common in obese people, or do I have to explain to you what blood is as well?You will grow to love the summer and hate the winter as you continue losing weight.I had the same issue after shedding ~130lbs. My toes and fingers get it the worst, but all I need to do is get moving and I warm right up again. The upside is that the summer heat doesn't bother me nearly as much as it does the rest of my friends and family :)Now you know what it's like for us skinny motherfuckers when tublords crank up the air conditioning to the icicle impalement setting.Haha I know it's kind of ridiculous. I just really like my hair... And I couldn't pull off the bald look, even if it happened in 20 years. You are mistaken. Many people ingest more calories then they expend and don't get fat. (Some stay super skinny, others maintain and others get muscular and built)

Gasoline has calories and your body has to do something with that gas if you ingest it. Using gas an example is not extreme - it just points out that the caloric content of the food you consume is but one factor of how your body has to deal with it. If you just look at calories you are consuming then you are looking at an oversimplified view of how your body deals with the food you eat.2oddly inept post, mods.

I'm at probably 500 calories at most. I eat carrots at lunch, and carrots at night maybe a boiled egg or two.Milk does have calcium- which is good for you. However, the people saying "calcium doesn't do anything for you in milk" are probably referring to the fact that you need to take Vitamin D in order to aid in calcium absorption. Doctors will tell you to take Vitamin D AND Calcium if you have a calcium deficiency, because Vitamin D helps your absorption. A good solution would be to get Vitamin D enriched milk.
For me personally, one of the more concerning things with cow's milk is the amount of hormones that go into the cow producing the milk. Just like women breastfeeding pass things on to their children, I can't help but think it odd that we drink milk from a cow that has been injected with so many hormones in order to be able to produce that milk.I'll try and explain simply. Feeling cold is heat leaving your body. If there is more insulation (ie. fat, clothes etc) then you stay warmer. Cold is not just a "sensation" you feel. It is actual heat energy leaving your body. Fat ppl have a lot more insulation so more heat has to travel farther to escape the body which obviously takes longer. They'll still feel cold on the surface but they're also a warmer inside. Think if you had a giant pot of soup and a small bowl of it. Which one would cool down faster if you put it in the fridge?

You can just do a quick google of the laws of thermodynamics to learn more about how energy transfer works and why heat would leave our body in the first place. This is grade 11 chemistry stuff but it's been a long time.
 It seems people had been conditioned to pick slightly (at times) on people whom were cold, if the person picking was comfortable. Having low body fat you'll shiver at the slightest drop in temperature. After all the "what are you cold?" questions I wait until everyone is wearing a jacket then I tell them. You? Wearing a jacket? You don't get cold. Your warm blooded. Eventually things have settled so that I (and the warmer) can co-exist in admittance of our chilled states. Another tip and look up for rehabilitation exercises online. Even if they seem easy still do them for a few minutes at a time and rest and ice etc.have you had your Achilles severed? if you just need to start holding onto something, squat down and breath.  Also a better quad stretch is to press your shin against an object while your other leg is in a lunge position.&gt; Because they have all gotten injured severely and/passed away?
&gt; Or because other activities are heavily marketed towards them, they buy into the stigma that they can't do what they used to anymore, and most of them have not been continuously fitness-oriented their whole lives?

Occam's razor says the former. The sheer level of mental gymnastics required for the latter explanation would leave even the most flexible of contortionists in the dust.anyone can add me if they want. id - ashishfageriaIt's still cheaper than buying lunch from a vendor/restaurant every dayI read multiple guides that say PPL is 4 or 3 day rest is fine.I had to scroll all the way to the bottom to find this, but I laughed.I'll eat once I hit my goal man. Also I eat a breakfast burrito with eggs and sausage almost daily.Had surgery in august 2014. Started working out again in first semester, but transferring to a new university kicked my ass and physics is a tough major. I stopped. Started again in January, new semester, got my life back on track with a meal plan and training plan. Started at 135x5x5 squat, empty barx5x5 bench, 155x1x5 dead, using strong lifts, put on 15 lbs and now training 225x5x5 squat, 135x5x5 bench, 255x1x5 dead. So that's a rough double in my big 3 total over 2 months. I hope to be eating 3 plates of squats for dinner soon! I want to compete in a power lifting comp one day. I'm 6 foot and 169lbs today.Not like you seem to imply. As you lose weight you'll use less calories, so you have to reduce intake more, but it's not like as soon as you go on a cut there's some starvation mode that happens. Just eat a bit less than you burn and you'll lose weight gradually.But Uncle Rhabdo... :(Yes being 'swole' will not matter social, but strength will dictate your life from 60 onward.  Loss of bone density, loss of muscle mass, joint instability and diminished work capacity are all common in the 60+ crowd.  So one could easily argue getting 'swole' (A never ending task mind you as you could always be better)should commit to the gym. Chasing 'swoleness' will allow you to live into your old age and be very active until Brodin calls you home.[Read about the health performance curve here](http://ancestralmomentum.com/2011/05/chasing-performance-at-the-expense-of-health/)

Yes, lift. But not too much (and not too little).

Do cardio. But not too much (and not too little).

Eat. But not too much (and not too little).I'd wager that would be the part of the title.

10 Proven Tips to Be Alpha

http://imgur.com/a/hUeaG/

Been an athlete but I took the last 2.5 years off of anything more than work/school and backyard sports/hiking/etc; back in the weight room for the last month and a half so I'm just getting back into it.

Feels good to be lifting again and I'm pretty happy with how much strength I retained from a few years ago for how much sitting around I've done. Probably gonna keep bulking for a while before I consider cutting so I don't have to flex like an ass to see any muscle, I don't know.Because its up to the individual to be doubtful, and it's up to the individual to seek the truth. Scientific method. It's not OP's responsibility to provide a source every time he or she speaks. It's up to *you* to decide whether or not you want to believe it, and if you should do any further research on the subject.

While chicken is great, there are steaks, pork chops, ribs, fucking PULLED pork - throw that pork roast in the slow cooker and some bbq sauce or just spices or google a reciepe. That shit is done whe you come home and will feed you for a couple weeks
hardboiled eggs
tuna
beans and lentils as was said throughout the thread
peanut butter and jelly as a snack after my meal
fucking nutella and jelly - i love this or with bananas

beef stews
chicken soups
thai soups
muchroom soups
chilli

mac and cheese - homemade none of that processed american shit, its a simple roux for fuck sakes - keep it somewhat healthy

Honestly, a little practice in the kitchen and some research via google and youll have tons of recipes. Change it up - dont be the boring brocolli and chicken bro.  Try some duck and broccoli. If you really want to feel awesome, get a cornish hen. NOTHING more badass than eating an entire animal in a sitting lol.

i once brought a hardboiled ostrich egg to lunch. Priceless.Pretty sure you're talking about a gymnastics move Behind-the-head overhead press.  It can feel good, but is that risk really worth it?I really try hard to make sure I get my gram of protein per pound of body weight, and I had to adjust my calories down when I stalled a bit. I did some statistical analysis this week, and I found that on days I got 123 grams of protein or more, I was highly likely to weigh less the next day vs if I got less. I track my food in myfitnesspal, and I found that when I eat less carbs I'm not as hungry, so I trade carbs out for fats and proteins when I can. I have some carbs (67g today) so I'm not doing keto or anything, but I find that less is better.

Specifically, for breakfast I have a quiche that I make weekly with eggs, sausage, spinach, and broccoli along with protein powder mixed into cold press coffee. Lunch is dinner leftovers, dinner is something that I can fit into my macros and cals. I eat a rather large salad with lunch and dinner to add some bulk to my meals. After work I eat a bowl of steamed broccoli with a dash of soy sauce and sriracha. At the end of the night I usually have a protein shake with jerky, peanuts, or sometimes chocolate or berries or something.

Keep in mind that if you budget for food is TDEE-500, if you go over by 100 in a day, you still ate at a 400 cal deficit which is pretty good, so don't beat yourself up.Haha exactly. Especially when people go heavy on it and try to get that last rep in and round their back. They don't feel it now, but they will laterRoutine? And are you cutting or bulking?Gains would still come, recovery might be a problem (e.g. soreness) and it would be a struggle/tiring during lifting, but it's doable. 


When I was in school, I would eat like shit and never hit my protein macros, but I still got gains. Caloric cycling isn't a new or ingenious concept that "destroys the traditional bulk and cut model". The author claims 2lbs of muscle gain per month using this method, which is hilarious. That claim would be more accurate for about the first year of a rank beginner who is fully committed to bulking instead of fucking off with it every 3 weeks. Nobody except the genetically gifted gains muscle that quickly unless they are untrained or on steroids.

I don't get people who are so adverse to gaining a little bit of fat that they want to over-complicate their diet and training and slow down their results just to avoid it. Just do a modest bulk and enjoy the results, and cut when you get fatter than you're happy with. You will always get better results more quickly by focusing on one goal at a time than trying to do both simultaneously.If you have flexible shoulders it feels perfectly safe. If I start to miss one I can just overhead squat down to drop near floor or take a step and I'm fineThis is pretty much what I'm doing! I've had some great progress! I was doing one rest a week but once my lifts increased to a certain point it was tough on my back doing deads and squats back to back twice a week every week. So now I sprinkle in a rest day when I know I need it. But I recommend PPL. I'm in the exact same position.  Down about 100 lbs and I feel cold all the time!  (I credit my low resting heart rate, but agree with the sweater/jacket comment.  I finally understand layers...or you know - have a lactose pill.Do not buy the bullshit. Milk is healthy. I have about 1L to 1.5L a day. I think GOMAD is a bit ridiculous, however, if you ask a M.D. (doctor) he will say it will cause intestinal bleeding etc. FUCK that, go speak to a real doctor (PhD) who studies the deeper physiology. Milk is not as bad as some have rumored.
The calcium in milk will DO something, however, there is not as much in there as you would believe. It depends on its absorption. For a normal person, with a healthy diet, milk will surely help you achieve your daily requirement (or advanced daily requirement). However, if you need to suppl more calcium, the only calcium that is really absorbed by the body is coral calcium supplements.

CheersWhich tdee calculator is the best?  Im getting varience of 500kcal on other sitesI'm curious about whey protein: a quick search on this subreddit reveals that the general consensus is that it's largely unnecessary and redundant, if not inefficient... so why do people still take it? 

I was considering starting some myself since I just started weight lifting, but now I'm having second thoughts...How does someone eat 900 calories a day, amazing progress though.Egg burrito.
Egg Sandwhich
Oatmeal
Protein shake
and alot of water.

Totals to like 1850 cals (9 eggs total). Can't recall macros off hand but I think I have like 140g protein and thats enough.No, people making unintuitive claims do have an obligation to provide sources, especially when discussing something as vital and prone to fuck-ups as lifting/fitness/health.

Hell, even seemingly intuitive claims should be backed up if they're not axiomatically true, god knows how much broscience seems intuitive but is actually bullshit (eat 6 meals a day, etc.)No there's no way, he would have been a skeleton. 

Probably not accounting for some calories there.Bodyweight exercises are excellent. I incorporate them into my routine and fully intend on going 100% calisthenics for strength training in a couple weeks. You should check out /r/bodyweightfitnessYes, they *do* have to worry about that too. Just like "fat as fuck" people like you.Every lift has some level of danger to it even if done with perfect form. But IMO this is a sport and EVERY sport has some risk of injury. So master form to extremely minimize risk and you'll make progress with maybe a minor injury here and there. That will only result in making yourself sick.Bench press, squat, deadlift. Rippetoe starting strength might be a good program to look at. Also, cut down cardio as much as possible (maybe once a week at light pace because your heart still needs exercise).
http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=998224Dude. Chill.This is kind of a low-key but super powerful statement. Thanks for this man.&gt; and long underwear.

They are also called thermals. You want to get them very tight fitting so they don't wrinkle up. They should be like a second skin. They sell high performance thermals for active wear. 

Don't wear Pajamas as another poster suggested if you are doing anything involving the least bit of movement.That depends on a lot....this seems like a perfect question for your doctorYea all those things can be remedied by doing yoga. Have you done yoga? Shit isn't easy, and requires a lot of strength, flexibility, balance, core work, and mental concentration. The OP wants something that will keep his mental acuity. Yoga also helps with that since meditating a bit is part of it.&gt; Bench press 3x5 OHP 3x5 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is too much in one day. I'm not putting up big numbers (180 3x5 bench and 120 3x5 OHP), but if you do these back to back the 2nd exercise will suffer. 

Exactly why I do my shoulders and chest on separate days. Really can't make much progress on OHP if constantly starting off on bench. And doesn't make sense to do OHP first since your chest is bigger than the shoulders, thus requiring more energy.

Bro if you have gyno then I definitely have gyno. My nips are super puffy and point out twice as much as yours. Just do as much upper chest, trap, and shoulder work as you can to stretch the skin and make your chest look tighter. Check [this article](http://paindatabase.com/body-fat/) out, someone posted it above. I would guess between 25-28%, as you don't seem to have much muscle on you.Your legs are intimidating as fuck. Only thing I'd say needs work is your chest, could just be bad genetics but it's definitely your legging part. Keep doing whatever it is you're doing for legs.Like... All the apples and celery and bananas and stuff. Don't see many people using this combo. when do you do your shoulders? do you deviate from the typical ppl format? i'm still trying to find a fix for this.K it looks like you aren't getting proper load in your hamstrings prior to the lift judging by the bar path and how your feet look to be slightly flexing onto the balls.  Try to really sit back more before pulling to load up your hammies and glutes.  Pretty minor fixes tbh, you have pretty nice form on both exercises.The best, Jerry. The best.Is this why fat people are always hot and sweating?Shin splints are annoying as hell. Try not to run too much too soon--there are programs like couch to 5k. They'll probably likely bother you anyways, so ice after runs as needed. 

Before runs, you can try ankle circles. I like taking an old Tyne rolling pin to the shin muscles to massage them.

On off days or after runs, you can try shin flexes. In bare or sock feet, stand with your heels on the edge of a platform or stair and the rest of the feet hanging off the edge. Then flex your foot upwards. You can hold for a Mississippi at the top if you want.Possibly. I am like that and when I dont eat I get colder nd I am going to srart a lifelong diet and i will be cold. Good thing it is spring.Best ? Throw darts.

All of them are "estimates" which require you to use your bathroom scale to determine real results, and adjust initial estimates accordingly.
M, 21, 5'8, 163 lbs. I have been on a bulk the past 3 months, and I'm wondering when I should start cutting. Also would love to here some suggestions/things I can work on. Thanks!

Flex: http://i.imgur.com/1jHxCur.jpg
No Flex: http://i.imgur.com/NtL6UQO.jpgYes I'm going to him soon to check it and get a hormone panel.no problem. I accept cash payments as gratitude also.&gt;Edit: lol bench bros so mad rn


I know reddiquette dictates that I don't just reply with "this" but... wow, *this*. Thank you.Silk is tbe gold standard. They are not big like pajamas.

I think some micropore may be good,ask rei,Just consider it food. If you are unable to get enough protein in your diet through normal food than use whey.Thats legit.Starting on Sunday, my routine is

- Chest
- Back/Rear delts (face pulls and reverse flyes)
- Legs/Abs
- Chest
- Back (No rear delt work)
- Shoulders (Delts and Traps)
- Rest

Basically I turned one leg day in a PPL/PPL into a shoulder day. I suppose if one was inclined, you could do Tues: Legs/Abs, and Friday: Shoulders/Legs.Bamboo is antibacterial too.Like what?This submission has been removed.

My PF has a squat rack and a "no deadlift" sign above it but he and I do them all the time, morning noon and night and have seem countless others do the same.

I've never once heard the alarm, and neither has my friend and he's been going there for years.

Some people do really well with short cycles like this, so try it for a few months if you like. I just expect that whatever is currently giving you problems cutting is still going to be a problem on shorter, more frequent cuts.As someone trying to recover from a shoukder impingement at the moment...fuck yeah! Bench can suck it! Fuck you bench press, I'm strong, beautiful, independent deadlifter and I don't need no bench!   

*cries*You'll get a good amount of fiber with the celery and apples for sure, which is good yes. I can see how the celery works taste-wise. Peanut butter combines well with it, banana and apple.No, nobody can tell you this, because there is no such thing as a weight you should be at for a given age and height.Natural fibers are significantly better in hot and humid conditions then anything synthetic. The moment you step into 100 degree weather with 50% humidity wearing anything synthetic you'll immediately regret your decision.This definitely sounds like what I experienced. For about a month now I had been questioning if I had been pushing myself too hard, guess that uncertainty and what I felt in the gym yesterday provide enough reason for me to take it a little easie . Thanks dude. (:Yeah, there's ways to do it safely, but OP did request lifts which 'average joe' shouldn't be doing.  You have flexible shoulders and a 'weightlifting' user flair - I think you're a little above average.How do you get so much protein? I eat eggs, chicken, and protein shakes and barely manage to hit 120g of protein. What are some easy to prepare go to foods/snacks that you eat that have such a high amount of protein?*WEE-OOOO* *WEE-OOOO* I'M A POLICEMAN! Those look amazing.
What body style you want to achieve... I mean for all I know you want to be a strongman who weighs like 275Cannot go wrong with chicken/turkey breast, brown/white rice/potatoes, a vegetable you'll actually eat.chipotle er um idkGood pointYour submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

Cook up some chicken breast and shred it the night before. Damn that's a good idea. I've been eating the Woolworths (not frozen) lamb rogan josh (two serves apparently, but whatevs I'm bulking). Costs about $10 a day, this will be way cheaper and take not much time at all. your not human, you are a godRead the Wiki...

Pick one of the beginner programs like Strong Lifts.Look at the wiki. there are a lot of programs listed, some which include charts that can track your progress or give you an idea of how to progress your lifts to greater weightsI didn't eat too much but did a lot of walking and still didn't lose weight (fat) was what I meant. I'm not complaining was just a little confusedisn't phat harder? i thought it required a deep knowledge of your routine for the adaptive part...pros/cons of phat vs ppl?Is there a difference between waiting for fat and then "converting" it to muscle, or eating and working out at the same time?No u&gt; Thoughts?

Metabolic damage is a myth.

It's about as debatable as 'Santa Claus is real.'

Track your calories. Weigh yourself. View trends over time. Adjust accordingly. Problem solved.


[Candito disagrees.](http://youtu.be/K9VGSjFLodo)I slow cook chicken breast with red sauce and then cook it. Then I can just throw it in a burrito with rice, shredded cheese, and southwestern ranch. It's the best, and very easy to makeSeparate your different muscle groups (legs, back, shoulders, chest) and take a few work outs for each muscle group (eg. Legs: squats with weights).
Use enough weight so that your body has to really work against it, but not too much that it causes you to use incorrect form, and even injure yourself. Do about 10 reps for about 2 sets. 
Your last couple pumps should be very hard to do, or the weight is too light. 

I hope this helped!Basically I just want to be what the average, healthy body weight is for my height. Not muscular, but also not fat.Well he wants cheap and healthy. Hence all the chicken recommendations. check out the 'adding exercise' link in the sidebar. There are quite a few programs linked there to check out. Also, a piece of paper and pencil works for recording your progress. Just try to slowly increase weight after you feel comfortable with a certain weightBreakfast: two large eggs, a 4oz pork chop, multivitamin and a banana

Lunch: 7-8oz chicken breast, 4 servings of broccoli and an apple

Dinner: 7-8oz chicken breast, 4 servings of green beans

Dessert: 1 cup non-fat greek yogurt, blueberries, strawberries and blackberries.

Keep at the weightlifting though, technique is insanely hard to master. I understand the appeal that comes with being tiny but surprisingly strong. okay so its not just me who thinks they are small hahaha but thank you for the compliment. Yeah, I am going to buy an ez curl bar soon, curl and tricep extend like no tomorrow, and give them the attention and love they deserve to become pythons. My honest thought. Why? what are your goals? Without that info this post is pointless.No reason we can't do both. In fact throw a low impact cardio like swimming and you will be set for life.I feel like every school needs to make yoga part of PE classes. Learn some good stretches that you can use for life.Mm. I'm definitely doing that this week, thanks for the tip!On mental acuity: I've read that it's beneficial to challenge your brain. If you're an accountant, learn to draw. If you're a designer, learn calculus. 

Additional things to consider: 

(1) Mental acuity doesn't matter if you suffer brain damage so drive safely, wear a helmet when you should, and use common sense around ladders and slippery floors.
(2) Practice stress management techniques such as meditation.
(3) Social interaction. Read about the research [here](http://www.nature.com/news/social-isolation-shortens-lifespan-1.12673). Essentially you want to spend more time with family and friends and be more engaged with your community.
(4) Sleep. Too little or too much sleep is harmful longterm.
 Honestly I would ask your pt if your able to squat more than once a week. Just start out light, then try again in a few days. If there's any sort of difference/discomfort compared to the last workout STOP. No need to injure yourself again. Also, try [bench squatting](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-squat-to-a-bench)I see it all the time around here. Specific example: "You should eat 1g/lb body weight of protein". 

In actuality: 

Hoffman et al. (2006) found no differences in body composition, strength or resting hormonal concentrations in strength athletes consuming either 0.77g/lb or &gt;0.91g/lb over a 3 month period.

Tarnopolsky et al. (1992) observed no differences in whole body protein synthesis or indexes of lean body mass in strength athletes consuming either 0.64g/lb or 1.10g/lb over a 2 week period. Protein oxidation did increase in the high protein group, indicating a nutrient overload.

Walberg et al. (1988) found that 0.73g/lb was sufficient to maintain positive nitrogen balance in cutting weightlifters over a 7 day time period.

Lemon et al. (1992) found no differences in muscle mass or strength gains in novice bodybuilders consuming either 0.61g/lb or 1.19g/lb over a 4 week period. Based on nitrogen balance data, the authors recommended 0.75g/lb.

All of which has been compiled [here](http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/)

That's actually a pretty good suggestion.

If you are committed to get healthy again...fight thru the pain and do the squats your therapists assigned you. 
If you are satisfied doing minimal work once a week then just get a wheelchair and roll yourself around.
Sorry but you need to hear the hard truth. There are a lot of amputees out there who would give anything to fight thru the pain of some scar tissue to get strength back in their legs. Make them proud by doing the work. Lower.  You are half squatting.Nice lifts for that physique (seriously no offense)Yeah, Dara O'Briain had a good joke about this. A dietician is kind of like a dentist and a nutritionist is basically a "toothyologist."Honestly it was probably the blanket statement.

&gt;strongman isn't exactly a healthy sport anyway.

and to clarify I meant at the elite level, being at that weight and performing those task aren't good for you, there is a reason most professional strongmen don't like into their 90's.

that said if i had to pick a form of strength training with the greatest inherent risk(excluding crossfit, which i don't view as worth considering) then Strongman would be it.Ha, the 20s? Cute. Here in North Dakota we broke into the positives. Now that's amazing. The air doesn't hurt my skin anymoreReduce stress and anxiety – have you ever found that when you are doing an important exam or in a stressful interview your mind goes blank on something normally very familiar to you? This is because stress can have a negative impact on memory.Also Dara O'Briain, who had a bit on Nutritionists vs. Dieticians, funnily enough. I definitely want to start benching and just get to 2 plates for reps as I feel I'm missing out on overall upper body strength. Once summer rolls around, I'll also be at the park hitting dips and pullups very often! Cant say I want to be tiny, but I definitely want to be strong as fuck hahaWhat. Lifting can very easily be shown to influence literally everything you listed.

Clearly, you don't even lift, if you think balancing a 500lb weight on your back requires less balance, core strength, and concentration than downward dog. Can you explain the difference between a recomp and a cut or bulk. I had thought they were types of recomps.Also not sticking butt out far enough, knees going past toes you're gonna have a bad dayHa true, I also keep a 5lb bag in one of the side parts of my gym bag(one like [this](http://www.essentialapparel.com/images/detailed/1218047_black_1.jpg)) and even if it doesn't seal all of the way, I never really turn my bag over so it stays put pretty well. Just an idea.182.67 Diet?The added volume from PHAT is good for size gains, what better than PPLI have been lifting pretty seriously for a year and a half, and every day I have been better than the day before. I don't have any pictures currently, but my current lifts are:
Bench: 215x5
Squat: 275x5
Deadlift: 360x5
OHP: 130x5

If you have a decent base, you can honestly reach a good amount of ripped within 6 months, and even if you don't, within a year for sure. The only issue is, once you start, you'll never be satisfied. You should look into using cannabis. It alleviates pain with no side effects. Have you tried any diet changes to try and alleviate/fix some of the joint issues? I have read (am not an expert) that eliminating certain things from your diet can lessen/fix some people's arthritis. Gluten, dairy, sugar, and sometimes foods from the nightshade family (tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, etc.).  I'm not trying to push a certain diet for everyone, but it might be something to try for a condition this severe. I'd go about it by removing one thing from your diet for around a month and see if you notice any difference. If not, add it back in and try to remove another. 

There are some things in the legal grey market that could help also, but I'm not sure I'm allowed to talk about them on here or not.Try yoga. It relieves you from arthritis and joint pain. After a short period you can add few body-weight or free weight exercises to your routine.I just got to 2 plates for reps (4) and still don't even have 15 inch arms. Fucking sucks man.

You can get a lot bigger with much lighter weights if you do it right.Don't worry about other people, try to make it simple on yourself by eating what changes the scale / your body composition the way you want it to be changed.

Yeah, this definitely needs to stop around here.

Something like this only works for axiomatic based knowledge, knowledge which is self-evident. An example of something axiomatic is "Eat more calories than you burn to gain weight, eat less calories than you burn to lose weight". 

Rich Piana said a cheat day is good... Do itChicken tomatoes? What is this madness?I keep it at 60 degrees. Takes stress of shoulders while still working pecs really good, and uses less tris.Thanks. I guess I should've thought about that. My goal is weight gain, but I'm not really stressing any sort of bulk. I just like to be active and fit. I have a buddy who is wanting to cut, and he drinks it sometimes. He is also not a smart man.Lack of strength is one of three main risk factors in elderly people for falling (the others are balance and taking more than 4 medications daily). Strength training is also better than yoga at preserving bone density.congrats man! that's definitely a big milestone in a lot of people's strength journey! You are right, I think I will start incorporating more  bodybuilding-esque techniques and also trying out more isolation movements with light(er) weights for them guns! It's gonna hurt sitting on a hard chair too. No one told me about that either. am currently 344. and yes that is exactly why.Oatmeal is a good one.Do u even lift?HE's good at his core strengths - and he trains hard - so he can just eat as he sees fit; the amount of training he does, I think he has to try hard to get enough calories every day! 

But regardless, he may not be on PED- as his bodyweight strength is 'intermediate level ' at best  - his pull ups, muscle ups and rope climb are pretty below par/average. 

His Oly lifting is excellent. (But not by Oly standards!)Morning: oats milk whey

A haircutKnees going past your toes is not inherently problematic. However, the OP is initiating the squat movement by breaking at the knees rather than the hips, which **is** problematic.It's true. I took 500mg CellTech at midnight and when I woke up, I was like a cut version of Andre the giant. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to have a godlike physique.
I'll just copy my top comment from the last time [a similar question was posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2r7shv/whats_a_good_snackmeal_that_i_can_eat_in_lecture/cndae10):

&gt; Sandwiches:

&gt; * They (generally) don't make noise when you eat them.
&gt; * They (generally) don't smell.
&gt; * You can make them fit mostly any macros you want.
&gt; * They keep well.
&gt; * They don't have to be re-heated.
&gt; * Sandwiches are yummy.

Not the exact same question, but you'll find similar responses there as well.Went from 126 (kilograms) to 109, started january this winter. Even though winter has been growing steadily hotter, I'm just getting colder.

Oh, for anyone wondering how I lost 40-ish pounds in three months...

I eat chips, drink alcohol, have an occasional pizza (actually did all three yesterday) and I do NOT have good genetics. As long as I can make every single day a challenge with limiting amount of meals (only one meal for the entirety of yesterday to compensate) and if you go anything beyond what you know is good for you, make sure that you punish yourself with exercise. I've walked 3 hours daily, every single fucking day, since January. If I'm not up for spending that much time, there's a solution: Run for 1 hour and 30 minutes. If you're not in shape for it, run until you can't anymore and walk twice the amount of time remaining.

My only successful attempt at losing weight comes from eating all the snacks I did before (so I don't go nuts in the long run and thus give up, the biggest weight loss enemy), but punishing it with starving, running or walking twice.Egg whitesBrett ContrerasWhen the coworkers ask op for fitness advice; "how important is tooth retention to you?"True enough. Nothing wrong with supplementing.

OP wanted a foundation that fit all his criteria now and when he's 60+. Yoga is that answer. Don't pick anyone up by the neck! PLEASE!- It's very dangerous and can actually break their neck or rupture nerves/veins/arteries. 

Don't even pick them up by the jaw/bottom/back cradling of their head - ! It's the same stress/pull as HANGING!Nah I come here to trollA sound allegory incoming:

We measure sound in decibel and hertz. In terms of decibel: There can be no decibel at all, this is absolute silence. It's beyond quiet, it's silence. Nothing. Cold is quiet, silent is the absolute zero. As you will notice, the only difference between cold and heat is our own relative point of view, same thing with quiet and loud. In hertz, same thing. The soundwave can have a higher frequency (it can go higher and higher infinitely as far as I know), basically same as decibel and celsius. There can also be none at all.Love that article.Those are called guillotine presses. You can do them, just light weight. Like what?oatmeal
protein powder
eggs
bacon
wheat bread
peanut butter
chicken
hot sauce
riceFoundation series by Eric Goodman, plus a 2 day a week light weight or yoga routine. Actually I do lift a lot. I've also done yoga quite a bit. But I doubt you've done any serious yoga before.

Squats do not require much balance at all, unless your using absolutely retarded shoes or something. It does work your core, and I did state that in my previous post. It also does not address "literally everything you listed". Or are you one of those idiots who uses the word literally, to not actually mean literally?

Also, a 60+ year old shouldn't be squatting 500 lbs. Just saying.those guides are dumb. if youre not hitting 2x frequency there is no point.Your dquat form is terrible. You are learning forward way too much1 - Dedicate time for more productive/important things? There are few things more important than safeguarding your health, and let's be honest, you were probably gonna spend that time bullshitting anyway.

2 - I don't know where the hell you got this idea, I'd love to see the statistics/polls behind this.

3 - Only a LOT of money over time if you're trying to do some kind of caviar only diet. Basic foods like oatmeal, milk, and chicken, when bought in bulk to hit macros, will cost less than buying the junk people usually do.

4 - You know what else costs money every month? Car payments, house payments, online video game payments, subscriptions, gas, the list is endless. I guarantee there are less important things you can cut down on to EASILY cover the cost of a monthly gym membership.

Now that that's out of the way....nah can't really think of anything.Muscle mass takes more calories to maintain, fat does not. As this is r/fitness I guess you meant muscle mass.

And that's what I tell people who go on diets without exercising. You are going to lose muscle mass primarily which is bad in the long run.Did you just "meh" criss-cross applesauce?I mean if no one had cheat meals/days, how would we all enjoy awesome food?It's not a squat, but even Ripp can pull 500 at 59 years old (despite his old injuries).

Also, clearly, you aren't lifting any meaningful amount of weight if you don't see the balance involved in squatting.Technically, yes, but usually when people say cut/bulk cycle they mean going for a long period (several months) at a caloric deficit followed by several months at a caloric surplus, repeated over the years. By recomp they mean eating much closer to maintenance, at the very most a slight deficit or slight surplus, and trying to increase muscle while losing fat. It is by its very nature somewhat slower than bulk/cut cycles, but if you look at it over the long run (5+ years) it is not significantly slower because

1. diminishing returns; everyone can only get so lean and so muscular without "help"
2. bulk/cut DOES take time, body recomposition by any means is a long-term project- after all, you're likely to lose some muscle on your cut and gain some fat on your bulk (again, assuming no special "assistance" is involved)

and over the very long run (10+ years) I am not sure it is any slower at all.

The real issue is that people want to see changes NOW NOW NOW. (Full disclosure, I admit I have that tendency too). Bulks and cuts offer that. You can see the scale, the weight, your measurements move much faster than on a recomp.I have the big hario hand mill and it does an *okay* job, it is a pain in the ass to change the grind size (I leave it at medium for aeropress/pourover).anything with one of those half stability ball thingsSplendid. Good luck friend :) [Not really](http://breakingmuscle.com/olympic-weightlifting/why-dont-olympic-weightlifters-overhead-squat-part-1)Soy milk has estrogen?!

I might have give that a goKeep your back warm,the back of your neck warm and youe toes.   If these spots are kep warm at all times it is so much easier to get you body temp up if you get chilly.


At least you're honest.Go to /r/keto and /r/ketogains brah. Very useful stuff. Btw, dextrose is the best form of carb to have before a workout on lowcarbTry watching olympic lifters.Push ups are a great beginner bench. Just because one old guy can squat 500 lbs doesn't mean every old person should. 

Strength, flexibility, balance, core work, mental concentration, mental acuity. These are everything I listed. Now you go ahead and try and figure out a way to argue weight lifting meets all those criteria. Blah. I hit 3 months in next week. 5'11"/M/27 started at 248 pounds@30.1% body fat. Now 225@19.5% body fat. Still probably close to 30+ ish pounds to go, but I've never been below 15% bodyfat in my life. But if i can lose 10% body fat in under 3 months, I can lose the next 10% in a reasonable amount of time as well. I'm the strongest I've ever been, and I love being able to consider myself athletic again.Not quite. Fructose doesn't go straight o the muscles like dextrose does These bars have a ton of fibre and they taste amazing This is the ideal snack when you have a sweet craving but you're on a cut.  They fill you up quite nicely.  2 of these and I can last no problem at work til lunch.You're not sitting back into the squat enough (probably wrong terminology, some one can explain it better.) 

I think you would benefit from some box squats. 

There really is no issues with having the elbows flared if your shoulders can handle the stress. Evidently, you will see more mass gains because you are taking out a lot of the tricep influence and enforcing and utilizing the anterior part of your body more.

I would suggest a minor bend in the lower back and to plant the shoulders back to completely disengage your shoulders too. This will likely reduce your weight but focus much more on strict form and just pec engagement. Looking at that picture... I would also recommend keeping the thumbs wrapped around the bar and keeping the bar more centered in the palm so the wrist isn't cranked back.High fiber/protein tortillas are GODLY.

This. If you want something to go by, try body fat percentage; it at least won't be as confounded by muscle mass or bone density.Yeah, your body won't absorb it all anyways.

No more stains, no more melted plastic, easy to heat, hold. Ye, normal Squats and conventionell Deadlift hit indeed your harmstrings aswell, but you want to keep a healthy balance, or you will strain a tear in your harmstrings. And usually in a Squat or a conventionell Deadlift your Quadriceps are doing more work.Not sure that's completely accurate. I'd say that the elbow flare moves the tension onto the shoulders, but actually decreases pectoral activation. You should be able to tell the difference just be simulating the movements while prone and feeling the way your pec contracts flared vs tucked. Holy fuck you are an inspirationIt only feels natural because that's how people start doing it. Once you have benched with an elbow tuck for a while you will hate the feeling of flared elbows.

Here's all you need to know about Anterior Pelvic Tilt:

- When you have APT, you're clinging onto your spinal erectors in order to stabilize your spine, rather than simultaneously activating your glutes, abdominal AND spinal erectors to stabilize your spine. Thus, your spinal erectors become "short."

- Hamstrings are a bi-articulate muscle, meaning they act upon two joins (knees and hips). If your erectors are short, they're going to take your hamstrings along for a ride and stretch those suckers thin as well. [Diagram of their connections](http://crossfitsweatshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/SuperFicial-Back-Fascia3-Posterior-Fascia-Line2.png)

- The worst thing you can do for your APT is stretch. Chances are, 9/10, you don't. need. to. stretch.. ESPECIALLY not your lower back or hamstrings. Most of the time, people are just stretching into an even worse position (e.g., hip flexor stretch - people hyperextend their lower back and end up not doing anything), or are only treating a symptom of the problem. People tend to say, "oh, this is area feels tight." And then neglect *what is actually causing that area to be tight to begin with.*

- LEARN TO STABILIZE. Deadbugs, RKC planks, glute bridges, hip thrusts, etc... By strengthening your Posterior and Anterior core you're going to fix your shit. Hell, most issues boil down to two things: anterior/lateral core stability and t-spine mobility.Jefferson Deadlift.

I mean, its a great thing for rotational training and a neat way to break up monotonous training... But... Goddamnit I always nut myself with the bar.http://jacktylerperformance.com/2013/10/13/pushpulllegs-split-strength-size-and-athleticism/

All of this are bad?Long underwear? Oh please reconsider.I"d say I"m fairly skinny myself but being fat or skinny doesn't always have to do with staying warm, it's all about what your body-heat can generate naturally. Think I'm still at around 145, 5'10 and I love the winter I don't bundle up much and when I do get cold my body tends to quickly heat up and keep me warm lol.&gt;If your "lean mass" was declining, that would mean your "body fat %" is going up.

Not necessarily, if fat mass is decreasing at the same time.

OP, if you're doing strength training and eating enough protein, you're already doing just about everything that can be done. In addition to the size of your deficit, make sure you're getting enough sleep. If those are all in order, chalk it up to an inaccurate scale. Impedance measurement is not very precise anyway.If that's the case I'd have to increase my calories a bit. I've gained 4 or 5 pounds in two months instead on one.I lift weights, swim, run, and practice yoga. Granted, I certainly have short-term goals in mind—but I think the mix of all these activities will serve me well as I age. My goals are to achieve balance, both in physique and in athletic ability.Thanks a ton man. Wait til you hit 130...Seriously, eat something. If you stay in a caloric deficit too long your metabolism slows. A HIIT program would be more useful along with a serious low carb diet. Keep protein and fat intake up for testosterone intake. If you only have to weigh in once then you could lose 5lbs in a couple days by cutting water intake. 

Is there a deadline for this goal or is it just ASAP?you need to stretch more. Try a groin stretch. Because smell is not a performance-limiting factor. Wet clothes however will limit your performance significantly. Getting wool dry in humid climates is almost impossible, unlike poly/polycotton.Squats. Yep, downvote away bros!Protein is not a "more is better" nutrient. Past a certain threshold, which is a little less than 1g per pound of bodyweight, it provides no further benefit, and the body just breaks it down for calories.

Nothing *bad* will happen if you drink a ridiculous amount of whey (other than protein farts maybe). But there's no reason you *should* do so, and food costs money.Yeah totally must be that, you fucked up. /sPretty solid. Depth was definitely below parallel. Your back maintained its angle. Ascent looked like a bit of a grind but was quite consistent. Wait, so I should be doing decline barbell bench press? I've checked it out and it's not a good move. Curry sauce has like 3 times more fat content than anything else.Smith machine leg pressI'm a fan of PB/J sandwiches. They're not messy, not smelly, don't spoil, and don't need heating. 

EDIT: I just realized that I'm not on /r/gainit and you're cutting. I'm leaving this anyway because fuck all of you. To be fair, the balance required to squat heavy weights is a lot different from other types of balance.

First off, having both legs planted on a stable surface is easy. Balance while moving on one leg is a totally different experience. How many people fall over while standing still with both feet on the ground? People fall when they are in motion, when their center of gravity is changing and often when on one foot.


Second, if you are actually good at squatting there is really very little balancing to be done. If you want to bring Ripp into this, then consider the part of SS where he talks about levers. Creating a lever arm away from the mid-foot during a squat is easy when you are squatting 50kg, try that at 200kg and you will fall flat on your face. Being able to squat 200kg doesn't mean you have good balance it just means you are able to squat with good form.


Maintaining equilibrium is part of the picture but correcting it is even more important. Squatting does not train fine motor skills in balance. Stand on a bosu ball with one foot. Do your hamstrings help balance, do your quads? Well yes, a little, but more importantly the smaller muscles that control movement of the calves do a lot of work. Can the squat train them? No. 


I'm not saying yoga is better than lifting but to say that squats provide all the balance training you need is absurd. Ok, tried reading it but he's making it too complicated. I used to fight and had to cut all the time while keeping my strength. There's a smart way and a dumb way. Dumb way, dehydrate. Smart way, diet. A good rule is nothing white, no white rice, no white bread, etc... whole grains, the white stuff just ends up being sugars stuck in your body i.e. fat. Eat sweet potatoes with the peel, and swim, swim all the damn time. Try this for two weeks and see if you don't notice a difference.True trueWalk up in here talking shit about chicken. It's crazy cheap, easy to make, and pretty healthy 

420 bake it Squatting at or below parallel with great form and with a decent amount of weight requires everything you listed. Literally... It's a joke. Calm down I've been taking creatine supplements for 2 years. No thinning or baldness yet. At the end of the day gains&gt;hair. Thank you, this will help!The squat won't be your only exercise. Every free weight exercise trains balance and propioception.

Beyond that, how many people squat with a monolift? How many walk out their squats? Walking out a squat is a balance exercise in itself. Hot sauce, I think. Or red BBQ sauce.This was a splendid squat! Great depth, good form, hard to check breathing; however, that I think you can check yourself. 

Solid Lift : ) 
When I'm working out or trimming I buy a couple of pounds chicken breast, grill and shred it, mix it with barbeque sauce, brown rice, peas, corn, and onion. I make a weeks worth of lunches and it's less than $30 a batch.On a bodybuilding level, Milk (and most dairy products) create a softer look.

However, I use milk in the off season because I love the taste and the ratio of healthy fats to protein ratio. you are going to fucking cry a river when you go swimming. I can't swim for more than a few minutes before I start shiveringProvided you're at the stage when your leg is well recovered and ready to squat, I'd start at a really light weight (like the bar) and still squat 3x a week, and continue to really work on mobility and breaking up scar tissue. That's really what you should have been doing during physical therapy anyways. 

Anecdotal: I tore my ACL a year and a bit ago and got surgery on it. First thing I worked on with my physical therapy was range of motion/mobility, second was getting balance/proprioception, third was getting my strength back. Once I had a strong enough base, I was able to start squatting and slowly worked up my weight. It will take a while for your legs to even out though. Even now, I find myself slightly favoring my stronger leg during heavy squats; that'll eventually balance out though.Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

This literally made me 'LOL'. 

Fat acts as insulation. Less fat, less warmth. 
#FitnessFreakProblemsI've been lifting for years, can squat/DL a lot of weight and am still thinking about taking his advice on a lift-cation for a month to work on form, ROM, etc.&gt; An example of something axiomatic is "Eat more calories than you burn to gain weight, eat less calories than you burn to lose weight". 

Even that is not self-evident as there is there is variation in how many of the calories you eat become available for use by the body ([example](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/17/E992.extract)). Sorry I went through something very similar. I broke the pinky metatarsal in my right hand and couldn't do a lot of the lifts. I don't know what kind of mobility you will have in any of your fingers will be, but you can still make gains. I focused almost all of my effort in squats. Front squats require no hands so that's easy. Back squats took some small adjustments that you can figure out for yourself. 

Pull ups are where we may differ. Since I still had my pointer and middle finger available I was able to do them well enough to not lose any strength there. 

I would steer clear of anything that would make one side of your body significantly stronger (single arm curls or db presses). 

They make wrist wraps with hooks that you could potentially use for deadlifts and shrugs. I'd say just go in the gym and see what doesn't hurt as much. It turned out to be a good thing for me because I focused almost entirely on my squat and had lots of love for it after I recovered. aaah

yeah i only drink dark roasts myself.   grand jobAgreed. There was a massively upvoted post about a injury doctor or something outlining the risks of squats. The tldr was its a must for athletes but not worth it for the average joe.Eat insoluble fiber like psillium husks (Metamucil). Soluble fiber gives the farts cause it feeds your gut bacteria, which is good. Insoluble just helps move things through and stimulates your intestines to release lubricant, which helps everything move through a little easier.good question, have been wondering this a lot myself latelyI get your point, it's a valid one. I am gradually putting more weight on my exercises, especially the squat which increases every week and a half (by 2.5 kg). I don't increase on all weights on the same day but shift them, so I don't get too tired. I am getting bigger and stronger, so it works. Thank-you and that's a pretty good explanation.  But my little tongue sticking out smiley was a way of indicating the facetious nature of my response :D

I don't think thefonztm was actually "grrr" upset over TanyIshsar's comment as much as he was looking to show off and be validated for his "special" knowledge of the physics of temperature.

Then again, this being reddit, you never know... perhaps he did splutter all over his monitor with rage that some ignorant layman(or woman) doesn't grasp these nuances of thermal science.

I know myself, when I'm outside in the snow in only a t-shirt and shorts, I like to refer to how negative hot it is outside.  And I know those around me are appreciative of my scientific way of expressing myself.

And in the tropics that damn uncoldness of it can get to me.  Although some might say it's not the negative cold it's the negative dry that gets ya.

Just shocking that people aren't 100% cognizant of the correct scientific way of referring to these things :D

(all my BS sarcasm aside, that is a good analogy Nikken6 :) )I like to do big batches of chicken breasts and a vegetable medley in the oven. I'll typically have two different seasoning variations going on—like cajun and garlic &amp; herb. I can fit 4 trays in the oven:

* 1 tray for garlic herb chicken
* 1 tray for cajun chicken
* 1 tray for garlic herb veggies 
* 1 tray for cajun veggies.

Cover the trays in foil first for easier cleanup.

For my last vegetable medley, I did zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli, asparagus, and red onion. Use whatever veggies you like. [Here's a good guide on how to roast](http://www.vegancoach.com/how-to-roast-vegetables.html). If using oil, you might want to use one with a higher [smoke point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_point).

If I'll be working out later, I might microwave a sweet potato to go with it. Poke some holes in it with a fork, blast for 6-7 minutes, cut it open and sprinkle some cinnamon over it. Boom.

This will typically last me for a couple days of lunch and dinner. I can also change it up and do salmon instead of chicken.It is common knowledge in the sense that there is no controversy over the fact that the function of the tricep is to extend the arm. These other muscle groups are much the same. The shoulder is certainly more complex, but most people know it is involved in the bench press.

The fact that a muscle is activated more when the weight is more aligned in the direction of contraction also isn't at all controversial, it is basic physics.

I don't really know what in my explanation would require a source. I really don't have a problem providing sources if they are needed, but I feel like I am being asked to prove that the quads are more quad dominant, or that the incline bench involves the upper chest more dominant.

Anyway, there are plenty of free lectures from credible colleges on exercise science. There are also a large number of books that go into biomechanics. A good place to start is:

Only thing I'd add is that I've heard (could be a bit bro science) is that if you're taking protein at night, it could be a good idea to use a mix of whey and casien, so that you get some protien slowly all night.Bench form is all about preserving your shoulders, and you should be as careful as possible about doing it correctly.

That and Greek non fat Greek yogurt make up my lunch (I skip breakfast because once I start eating I can't stop) almond milk in my protein shakes saves a ton of calories and keeps the flavor.

Get my 5x5 on the compound lifts and then I do a little bit of accessory work. I'm working out about 5-6 times a week. Push ups, dumbbell press, and machine presses. In general, exercises which are harder to do wrong that still work the chest pretty well. 

The "more effective" part may be a cheating a little bit because I don't mean that those exercises will give better chest development (though some argue DB press does), but rather that they might get better chest development when they aren't using their shoulders so much.How many eggs?

Thanks buddy Here is the best way to deal with bad knees / shoulders. 

Do bodybuilding exercises. Low weight and really focus on the contractions. 

High reps, Low weight. Eventually this training style will increase strength in your stabilizers and allow you to start doing the lifts you cant currently do :) In cross country I got shin splints to the point I was dying of pain at the end of each run (which could be up to 12 miles) and I was taking more Motrin than healthy (I didn't know they fucked up your liver so much and I was popping like 6 at a time for months) but icing my shins put an end to that!  I had to do it every night, 30 minutes of icing and no more Motrin! Keep up the great work!For some exercises, you would be well off starting with a bodyweight version of the exercise and not moving to a bar until you can successfully complete them with proper form. Bodyweight squat, pushup for bench practice, especially getting used to keeping your elbows at 45 degrees. It's also convenient because you don't have to join a gym to start practicing, so it saves you time and money until you're confident.

Thanks for some more inspiration. Really, all of you here in r/fitness you are all a great inspiration to for one start working out and to continue always encouraging and not shaming. Also thanks for dispelling a lot of bro science. How old are you in the before and after?Sounds to me you have an imbalance of healty bacteria in your stomach (hyperacidity)

Normally proteins, which are amino acids, essentially trigger special cells in your stomach (called G cells) to release a hormone called gastrin, which is responsible for triggering the release of acid from your stomach.

If you're stomach's bacterial flora is such that it already promotes an increase in acidity (probably due to shitty, unhelpful types like Helicobacter pylori), getting that extra amount of protein will result in too much acid being secreted.

Best would be to tone down the protein shakes and separate it into smaller portions but with higher frequency. Also try taking some probiotic yogurt to ease the imbalance. Should help and resolve in about 2~3 weeks if you keep up with the probiotics.

Don't do that.To elaborate on intolerance: 

Genetically, lactose-tolerance in adulthood stems from regions with a long (many thousands of years) history of cattle domestication and agrarian society. So people of Caucasian and to a lesser extent Hispanic ancestry have the most likelihood of being able to tolerate lactose. I believe the majority of Caucasians can but I may be wrong. Native Americans, Africans, and Asians, however, do not have a history of rearing cattle and as such never evolved to tolerate lactose on the whole. This is why those regions are associated with a majority of lactose-intolerance. thanks for the advice, no creatine really. The only creatine I get is from the shake itself, it has a little bit of it.

O  Very informative advice. I need to ramp up on my probiotic intake, I usually have about 3 times a week. I had previously suffered from H.pylori about 8 years ago and I know exactly what you are talking about. I do not know if this is true, but I heard that the bacteria lies dormant, inspite of the antibiotic course. 

What are your thoughts on digestive enzymes?Looks ok.... I would get your chest out a big further and really make sure you tighten up everything on the descent. 

You are also falling forward a tiny bit. 

DISCLAIMER: I am not an expertOf course, I wasn't trying to argue that. I was just saying that while squatting does require and can improve balance it is not exactly complete.

The majority of workouts people use leave a lot to be desired when it comes to balance and stability (simply because it is not a priority). I have always found that unilateral exercises such as split squats require more balance and coordination than normal squats.

So the point I really should have made is squats are great. However. they should be utilised mostly for their strength benefits and accompanied by something that taxes balance more.When you say 35, do you mean negative 35?How? Big magnet?So Canada? Why have I not heard of such things beforeI would be willing to, but I'm also worried about the atmosphere that some gyms have stereotypically cultivated. Would I really need a gym just to get toned? I'm not really looking to pack on huge amounts of muscle, just enhance and define what I already have.That's abit crazy. Some people take 12 months to lose just 25lbs.Mass homeothermy lol.But I'm around 20% bf.

I'd say take the weight down a little and progress more slowly. 

A slipped disc is no fun, so make sure to take it slowHey man, at least you didn't shave your head in the winter. I did that and it felt like somebody was continuously pouring a bucket of ice water on my head. I think 8-10 lbs can attributed to water weight in the first week. After that 2 lbs/week is advised.Generally have baked beans and a banana or something for breakfast, a packed school lunch of eggs, tuna, fruit and a chicken sandwich, and then generally some more meat when I get home. Its worked for me and I've only got 2 kilos to go before im on my first proper bulk :) When doing leg press I feel like the weight as it comes down is pushing down on my ribs, i've tried to have a wider stance as i'm coming down as to sort of dodge my ribs however i still get the pain in my ribs. Does anyone else experience this?Unless you have lost a lot of water weight which is highly unlikely, loosing a pound a day means you cut off 3500 calories a day from your diet which is really unhealthy. The deficit should be closer to 1000 calories a day which results in 2 lbs lost every week.http://youtu.be/u6UgD1H_AXwI am pretty sure timing is relevant. I have read and been told by my gums fitness instructors that you have a 20 minute window after working out that you should have your protein shake as this is when your muscles absorb the most amount of protein.A good mental cue is to try and "bend" the bar on the way down so your elbows tuck in more and you activate your lats. Also keep a constant push through your feet to stay tight, take a big breath and squeeze your shoulder blades together. Seems like a good plan to me. 

I usually like to do:

Chest/tri -abs

Back/bi

Shoulders - abs

Legs

Abs/cario

I don't like doing both my Bi/Tri on the same day (to avoid stretch marks by getting a pump in both sides of the arm)

but also he has arms at the beginning of the week, this doesn't make complete sense to me because you'll need your arms to do compound chest and back exercises on those chest and back days

but overall its a decent plan. Make sure to get your protein shake in the morning and after your workout. no, cutting. All I can think about is the delicious food I can't have.Capilene*It depends on your experience and years spent lifting things up. Early on you can allow yourself going to gym six times a week to hit each muscle group twice because your recovery is good, accumulated fatigue is low and you respond really well to high frequency moderate volume training. 

As the years go by the diminishing returns effect kicks in - to progress you need much more volume or intensity and thus you have to lower the frequency and increase the rest periods. Basically - how much fatigue you accumulated and how close to your full potential you are the dictates how often you can train the same muscles without feeling burned out This. Also dont forget that the majority of /fit/ is full of kids that just starting to lift. So they tend to go all out without understanding what they do.I was 16 in before and 21 in after.

Used lifting during my teen years to keep me focused and on track. Good point.That literally has no effectbon what i said. There are plentybof teens out there with decent form with someone looking over them. Id bet as many teens lift with bad form as most the adults you see in the gym. It's expensive, but the [Fitbit Surge](https://www.fitbit.com/surge) may be what you're looking for, if you're looking for a GPS device.

So would you recommend moving arms to the end of the week instead?What would you recommend in place of them?Questbars?Quest Nutrition Bars and MusclePharm Combat Crunch are two top sellers usuallyI understand your concern but to quote /r/bodybuilding:

&gt; Don't devalue opinions and experience by dismissing them as "broscience". This subreddit is not a site for vetting only scientifically provable propositions. Remember, science, particularly in the area of sports and nutrition, is evolving rapidly. Our experience, though anecdotal, can help fill those gaps until the scientific community reaches consensus.

And I googled the article in my reply for/u/lolfunctionspace, so I think I don't have any obligation to provide any source. I answered one person's question with my knowledge and experience (for free), I don't published a goddamn study. Take it with a grain of salt.Ok Mr high horse.I would recommend doing your chest and triceps together on the same day, your back and biceps together on the same day, shoulders after that, then legs after that. 

The idea is that you always do the larger muscles first. 

So on chest/tri day, do your incline, flat, dumbell benches first, then last thing you'll do for the day is exhaust your triceps

back and Bi days you'll do all your pull ups, rows, etc etc  and then last thing of the day is to exhaust your biceps

Next is shoulders, you can almost exclusively do shoulders with cable flys and 10-20 lb dumbells, no need for any other muscle group

then last your legs

This way you have a full 4-5 days between each muscle group for your muscles to repair. its not only about working out your muscles, but giving them the time and fuel to repair, to *grow* to get bigger and stronger. Maybe you should show people that level of respect regardless of their age. Very likely not the most effective way because you are training every muscle group only once a week. As a beginner you can benefit from more frequent training with full body programs and more compound lifts. Read the Wiki from the sidebar for the recommendations.

http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bro+splitYeah, I probably got a little too excited with stacking the weight on. Video was super helpful, I'm gonna go lighter and work on the back rounding. Cheers, mate :)ass through grassits easy to do, we always wanna lift more than before right? Just remember that its easy to hurt yourself doing deadlifts, and back injuries are no joke, take it slow. Also: peep chi gong standing, or "standing like a tree", otherwise known as zhan zhuang / post standing. You can do it for 5 minutes, it will make you very warm by increasing circulation, and it has *ridiculous* health benefits. This is one of those practices, like meditation, which is aggressively avoided or challenged in the west, it's stupidly simple, and really effective. Maybe that's why so many people hate it.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhan_zhuangi didnt see stretching psoas on your list,you didnt tpuch on them. ive read many times that thats a big part of fixing apt. can you clarify. and how would strengthing "posterior core" (lower back?) help with apt. and why should we listen to youThanks very much. I'm doing a hybrid for strength and hypertrophy. Abs are not important to me at the moment, i'm very skinny and just wanting to get large and strong firstly. What could I add in to make sure i'm getting my calves and rear delts?

Also, how does strength progression work with P/P/L? I want to carry on progressing with my squats, OHP, deadlifts and bench.

Thanks for your advice, mate.looks good IMOI saw in a previous post with a few hundred responses that among people who took it, those who did notice signs of balding saw them pretty quickly (within a few weeks/months). Those who stopped taking creatine after that stopped seeing signs of balding, and for them it wasn't anything really noticeable (maybe some thinning).

I'd say take it and if you notice any early signs of hair loss, just stop. It is based on whether you're predisposed to hair loss, so if you think you are then you may decide not to take it.If you're looking to build muscle mass, you need to move heavy weight. If you just want to lose some fat, just run and drop your calorie count while keeping protein high. The third should be the fourth. The actual third is to never stop learning new things and challenging yourself mentally. It's one of the best things you can do to prevent many of the neural diseases of old age. 

So learn new languages, learn instruments, take up dance, write poetry, learn different areas of mathematics, learn to program, etc. What if you're a 5'0" 100lb girl? What if you're a 6'6" 275lbs man? Rear delt flyes or face pulls are good for rear delts and seated and standing calf raises for calvesThey showed that creatine increases DHT, and DHT has been linked to hair loss in people who are predisposed to baldness (MPB). I think based on that it's very plausible to believe that creatine could increase/speed up baldness for *some* people.

Just because a study hasn't been done linking it doesn't mean it can't be true. If there was a study that showed *no link*, this would be a whole different story. Science isn't "innocent until proven guilty", and what's true and false isn't dependent on whether we've done a study on it yet. That's not to say that any wild health claim has merit because it hasn't been disproven, but in this case there is some evidence that shows a connection.4-5 days of rest is way more than a beginner needs and is basically hindering progress.

I am by no means overly knowledgeable about this though, I am still a novice in lifting seriouslyTry doing pushups with your knees on the floor. For pullups, get a chair and do negatives (Start at the top and go as slow down as you can)Becasue hes rightTake barbells (or anything that's rather heavy), lay on the back and do 'bench press' with them, that's gonna work your chest with a weight you can manage.

Well, one of them I guess.Or as they're known in some circles, STR, DEX, and CON. Run outside. Running in a treadmill is the worst. I can get ten miles outside but treadmill one is a chore. Nothing better than running around a populated area and taking it all in. Headphones also make it harderI actually watched FuriousPete's recent dieting video and it made me go into a ''cut''. I really like his way: Prepare a bunch of meals at the start of the week, eat those 2x a day, rest of the time (except breakfast, you want a bunch of carbs then) you should eat small snacks like a protein bar, a banana, some cashews etc. Just eat in proportion 5-6 times a day.Too much protein can cause [kidney stones](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/basics/causes/con-20024829).

Why do you think it can be salty..When you flare out, you stretch the clavicular head of the pec and put immense tension in the insertion into the humerus. If you have a weak anterior delt that can't help out, you are begging for a accident to happen.

From a bodybuilding perspective, your anterior delt is taking the pressure from the pec, so you don't get growth.Strength Standards checks how strong you are according to global standards. Offers you the best strength training program generator and 1RM calculator. You can visit the page [here](http://www.strengthstandards.co/)Assuming you're 5'10, 81kg and the amount of muscle mass you have is negligible, this is what I would do:

2 months of maintenance calorie intake (For your stats it'd probably be somewhere around 2500-2600kcal) while doing some basic strength program like StrongLifts 5x5 or similar to get a base going. Make sure to keep your protein intake at a sufficient level.

After this period start moving into a caloric deficit. ~2000-2100kcal should do it for you depending on your lifestyle. 

Then try to decide if a program like this is something for you. Maybe move on to a more intensive regimen or try something different - the most important part is that it is something you can stick with long term.

When you get going with a deficit and a decent regimen is when the grind really start. Continue until you reach target weight. You may find you'll need to bulk up some after.

That's the way it should be. The bar path in the bench press isn't strictly vertical. At the top position the bar should be somewhat above your upper chest or so (depending on your arch), at the bottom position it should touch somewhere at your lower sternum (depending on your proportions).

&gt; So why is that way considered correct form, and why is elbows flared bad?

Increased risk for shoulder injuries. Here's a relevant passage from Starting Strength:

&gt; But mechanical considerations are not our only concern. We need to be able to train the bench press without injuring our shoulders. Shoulder surgery is a GREAT BIG DEAL, I assure you. This makes anatomical considerations very important in an analysis of bench press mechanics.
&gt; The press is never a problem for shoulder health because when you are standing, the scapulas are free to rotate up and in toward the spine as you drive the bar up. This allows the scapular position to accommodate the humerus locked in line with the forearm, so that there is no impingement between the bony knobs on the lateral scapula – the acromion and coracoid processes – and the rotator cuff and bicep tendons. The scapula gets out of the way of the humerus because it can “float” into a position that doesn’t hurt anything (Figure 3-5). In fact, the scapula is pulled out of the way by the trapezius muscle as the bar is shrugged into lockout.
In contrast, the bench press position traps the scapulas under the rib cage into a solid platform against the bench as the chest is shoved up and the back is arched. The scapulas are adducted – pinched together or retracted. They do not move if the position is assumed correctly, because they are functioning as the interface between the body and the bench. Therefore, they cannot accommodate the humerus if it approaches the bony processes. Since the scapula cannot adjust to accommodate the humerus, the humerus must accommodate the scapula by staying out of the way of the bony processes so that they don’t saw a hole through the rotator cuff tendons.DYEL?Great job man, truly inspirational.

I once choked on a gum during a last rep. Never again.I recently learned/ realized that form is waaayyyy more important than weight. Since I'm doing 21's, slow and controlled, in stead of 'regular' barbell curls, I can only manage half the weight. And I don't care, because I can feel I'm training my biceps better.

Why I'm saying this: you might be lifting too much weight. If you can't lift the weight with correct form, find the weight with which you can.Never did understand this either. 

Flared elbows/arms in benching is a no-no, but wide arm push-ups are ok?

I think he means they whip the bar back using their lower back muscles in a matter somewhat similar to an overly explosive deadlift. It does, but not maliciously. As you lose weight, it doesn't take as much energy to move around, some muscle loss is inevitable during a cut so you lose that metabolic activity, etc.

This isn't metabolic damage, it's just physics.Well you can bitch at this, but pretty much all your points are useless, because you're explaining blah blah blah muscles spinal erectors blah blah don't stretch whatever, but you're not giving actual practical exercises that help fix APT.

Second, Dorian Yates doesn't necessarily "swear by it". He praises inclines just as much. He swears by any chest movement that isn't flat bench press since he thinks it is a compromizing movement. 

Why? Probably because he has had a very injury prone career.

Good things we're not in that subreddit then.

&gt; Our experience, though anecdotal, can help fill those gaps until the scientific community reaches consensus.

This is basically broscientific code language for:

&gt;Pulling shit out of our collective ass is superior to evidence.

It is far, FAR better to say "I don't know" if you have inconclusive evidence, than to say "Well, this is what I think (but have little to no evidence for." The former suggests humility, grace, and true knowledge, whereas the latter only suggests the semblance of knowledge. This subreddit's ability to accept "I don't know" above unfounded opinions would make it a 100 times better of a subreddit.

Keep up the good workGood on you for making a start. I'd reconsider a cheat 'day' and have a cheat meal instead, but perhaps once every 2 weeks. If your calorie deficit every day is 500 calories (or whatever you have me I set as),  then you eat a 2000 calorie pizza, then you've just reduced that deficit to 200 a day. If you're also counting exercise calories then they are very easy to over estimate, and before you know it, there is no calorie deficit and you stay the same, even though you are eating better quality calories.
My advice, watch your portions (you sounded unsure about the calories in the prepared meals); drink lots of water; don't include exercise calories; have 1-2 slices of pizza and fill up with a big salad on the side or you'll undo your hard work.
It's much more important what you do the 23 hours a day you're not in the gym..Good luck! The squat video is so incredibly homoerotic.

They basically just cut some ligaments out from somewhere, tied them up to hold my knee in place, chucked a pin in and shaved down the groove that the kneecap sits on ahahah I thought the same thing when i lost weight, winter got so cold and my hands especially are always freezing cold. The pros of the weight lost make up for it though.
Congrats on your weight loss!!Your training routine clearly priorisites your upper body. You have two and half work out sessions for upper body but only half for your legs (walking doesn't count.) Almost half of your muscle mass is located in your thights and calves so unless your legs are very much ahead in progress I would recommend using atleast 1/3 of your training sessions for lower body. Maybe push/pull/legs would be a better split.
Sry about bad english, hope it's readable.Hey I'm sorry, I read that entire thing but that entire 8000 word article was the biggest load of bullshit I evever read.

If even said in there that you should warm up with your heaviest weight!

That's a sure fire way to injure yourself. 

Not only that but the entire article just said everything SUCKS and didn't back it up with any logical knowledge or sources. It said that ALL the articles point out that all those classic says of growing muscles DONT work. 

Then wtf have I been doing for 8 years, and I'm defintiely buff enough to know what works and what doesn't.

OP don't read that article. Follow what I wrote and ur good; research SCHOLARLY articles on Google.com/scholar 

There's so much BS fitness advice on the Internet its laughable. Next you're going to tell me that cross fit is a revolutionary scientific method for strength training. GoddddSo, to do what you should have done:

Can't find "etc" Examine.com for what supplements are worth it.&gt; Is there anything I should change with my routin?
No, you're off to a good start. However, I fear that it might be a little too much at once which makes it hard to stick to. Try focussing on your diet first, exercise routine second, cardio third.

As far as your routine goes, I'd like to know why you didn't pick one of the recommended starting routines (e.g. Starting Strength, Strong Lifts, etc.)?

&gt;Is it ok for me to have a cheat day?

In my opinion: yes! I am a sucker for fatty food and alcohol as well so I might be a bit biased in this department. My goals are different from yours though. I want to gain strength, shedding fat would be nice but normally both don't go hand in hand (unless you're a beginner).

&gt;What protein are you recommending?

This is a controversial topic, but here is my take on it: your body at maximum needs 0.8g of protein per poound of Lean Body Mass - your weight minus your bodyfat percentage. For example, I'm 194cm and 109kg (240lbs), with an estimated bodyfat percentage of 20-23%. Therefore I need roughly 150grams of protein a day. A normal western protein-rich diet of meat, dairy, eggs etc. will fill in most of this requirement for me and hence I forgo buying protein shakes.

&gt;When can I expect results, or is it possible with this routine?

Slow down, temper your expectations! The old saying goes: it's a marathon, not a sprint. Every body reacts different to dietary changes. Yours just might still be adapting. In the end, if you're eating at a deficit you will see changes. Just stick with what you're doing now. As far as your routine goes, it's hard to tell without knowing what exercises you actually do. However, I recommend looking into the beginner routines listed in the FAQ as they have been proven to work.

The risk of actual death is higher with bench than anything else, yet ppl love bench and hate squattingHey Guys,

About 2 weeks ago i released my new **material design fitness tracking app** for android, and posted about it in a few small subreddits. The comments and support were amazing, so i thought maybe you will like it to and I should also share it here.

So I've been working on the app for the better part of a year. There are obviously a few apps out there, but after using them in depth, they had issues, missed some needed features or had pretty bad UI. [This is what I came up with](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sqvat.squat)

**My Story**

I started working out two years ago. Like a lot of folks, it took a while to actually understand what I was doing. Once I did understand, though, I realized how simple it all is. Consistent and hard work = results. However, keeping track of my progress became a pain in the ass. I scribbled down my sets and reps at the end of each workout on a piece of paper. Suffice it to say, that sucks.
I would also lose count of sets during the workout, especially during 7 or 10 set exercises. Often I would end up doing one set too few and feeling pumped at how easy it felt. After one especially strenuous workout, I knew something had to be done. No more forgetting to jot something down and losing track.
I quickly found a few workout apps, and began using one of them. Though it did its job for the most part, it was buggy, complicated, missed core features i needed and not even #HOLOYOLO.
After cycling through every recommended app and remaining unsatisfied, I did what every normal, sane fifteen year old would do, I developed my own app.

**The App**

I see a lot of potential with this app, and I have a bustling Github issue tracker with lots of work to be done and new features to come , but I wanted to take this to you guys and see what you thought. Surely I'm not the only one looking for a simple workout app.
Right now, Fit is fairly straightforward. You can enter your routine by adding workouts and then selecting from the database of exercises(with videos!) or adding your own. Then, you can workout and enter your sets and reps for each exercise, and the timer comes on automatically. Of course all of your workout data is being saved, and you can check your workout history. The app is also connected to Google play games and you can get **achievements** for your hard work, Oh yeah, and most importantly, it's **100% Material Design :D**

We had a very unseasonably warm winter, the trees were blooming in early March.  That summer we had consecutive days of 100+ degree temps.  

It was the *next* winter that it hit me.  Literally.  Any type of gust of wind would just cut right through me.  No matter how many layers, hot showers, time in the tanning bed...  I was always cold.

Since then we've had two shitty winters and very mild summers.  I feel like I have to set myself on fire to feel like I'm at normal body temperature.  I'm praying to all kinds of deities that we have a summer with temps in the 90's.  For the entire summer.I took this from another redditor's post but don't know who to credit:

* Can perform 1 good form pushup ??? too easy (female) or 2 good form pullups (male)

For the average middle age professional, using fitness standards similar to these makes a lot more sense than using powerlifting strength standards to gauge fitness. I think it's more sustainable as well. As you get to retirement age, you want to see the consequences of long term good habits. An active lifestyle with lots of physical activity like walking, a few strength/mobility workout sessions per week, and solid moderate calorie, adequate protein dietary habits. You don't want to get old with joint and spine problems, so lifting should be looked at from a risk/reward perspective. already doing that, so I should still doing the volume?There are multiple other templates of 5/3/1, check the book.

If I am still hungry I keep a muesli bar or a protein shake near as a last resort snack. Maybe for him it feels right, but when low bar squatting, you should have your wrists in line with your forearms using a thumbless grip (so he's doing it wrong).  For a high bar squat position, the bar is on top of you traps as opposed to your rear delts, which can cause more movement so people will normally use a closed grip with their elbows down and not behind.Joker setsshoulders in actually recruits more triceps which gives you more power; you can ultimately lift more, properly. just a matter of getting the movement pattern down and making sure your arms aren't your weak linkFixed.Why was I reading your post in the voice of Baz Luhrman? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoIYour submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

So you're pretty much doing a high bar squat with the bar slightly lower on your back. You have a narrow stance, more or less upright back, and you're going below parallel.

Normally in a low bar squat the heels are placed wider apart (&gt;shoulder width), toes point more forward, and the forward lean is greater. 

Now if your aim is to get into powerlifting or just move a shitload of weight quickly, low-bar is probably the best idea. If you're just doing it for general fitness, there's nothing wrong with high bar. I tried low-bar for a while as well, it just wasn't for me. Maybe try looking into hybrid squats if you're unhappy with high bar? [This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu6-KiPL89c) video by Candito is pretty informative.

Its a unit of measurement if a physical entity. Calories are no more "non  in reality" than ounces, seconds, or degrees.

**Ground Chicken or Turkey "Pasta"**: Either julienne slice a zucchini to make zucchini pasta, OR spaghetti squash (they're about $1.25 and make 2-3 portions) but the squash is a bit higher in carbs.

The thing I want to clarify here if it wasn't clear is that these meals are not precooked in any sense. Each week they send us groceries and a menu with 5 recipes that we could make with the food they sent us which we do. But I'll try to be better with the counting. And ye I always add everything else to myfitnesspal. I even ad coffee just to get into the routine of adding everything:) Make it easy for yourself and go for an easy start. Start by just going to the gym and working out a few days a week, get the endorphins pumping, try not to eat complete shit but don't worry about bulking and counting calories until you feel ready for it.

For example: week 1 day 1: work up to 12rm and do 2-4 back off sets. week 1 day 2 4-5x6, week 2 day 2: work up to 10rm and do 2-4 back off sets. week 2 day 2 4-5x5, week 3 day 3: work up to 8rm and do 2-4 back off sets. week 3 day 2 4-5x4. then start back over.I just get them at my grocery store in the section with all the other pepperettes.

Looks solid aside from that, nice squatI probably owe Nike 12 bucks for this.... but just do it?See, that's what keeps me from trying it...Not if you're thin. You'll see. 
And if it's the fabrics sticking together you're worried about under armor style fabrics are pretty good about not sticking to jeans and running pants.Honestly, even an excellent pair of boots and a good hat will go a long way towards keeping one's self warm. I had to unplug a rural sewer line in -30C weather. I wore my mukluks, a hat that covered my ears, a regular pair of pants, a regular shirt and a bulky sweater and I was warm. Stomping about in the snow might have helped, but I swear my feet were the furnace that kept my body warm.One thing I found that's incredibly good is a little bit of oyster sauce instead of the typical bbq/hot sauce/America sauce. Give it a try, you won't be dissapointed.
I'm currently doing my own modified PPL routine which I love doing and have a few exercises I would add to your routine to make it even better...

* do Incline Dumbbell chest flyes on push day
* add Shrugs to pull day
* add Leg Raises to leg dayI think you are on the right track then. I estimate your TDEE as 2194 so a 500 cal per day deficit would be 1694. You can then use that 3500 calorie deficit per week to make the decision on the cheat meals and dinner/drinks with friends.I disagree, but again opinions are like assholes we've all got one. You aren't really stating a reason for your opinion but my reason is the faster drying. non-absorbent qualities of synthetics along with the fact they are light, something I much prefer in hot and humid climates such as when I'm on a rafting trip. They suck at odor resistance so need washed after each use or close to it (newer fabrics are somewhat better) but do work well for rain/heat with high humidity. I've yet to regret using them in such conditions. 

http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/underwear.html

That does a good comparison which echos my own opinion. 

http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/comfort_moisture_transport_wool_synthetic_clothing.html#.VPr9kXXN_Zs

Is probably the best test of synthetic and wool (and still it misses really light synthetic layers being tested), my high humidity in heat comment seems to hold true for Alan here and synthetic top was prefered by Don in heat as well.

To each their own I'm only echoing my experience and opinion. I never started at a planet fitness, but they bought out my small gym, twice. It usually took a few months for them to fully adopt all the PF silliness, in the beginning it was my same gym with a new sign... and a lunk alarm... lolYeah I do that a lot but I would like to be able to hold players off as well. I also play basketball where that would come in handy as well. I use this approach and it works well. Your willpower is a limited resource and will run out (http://www.wired.com/2012/10/mf-willpower/) so make sure you make the decisions that are most important to you early! Looks good but wouldn't squat with those shoes, try without shoes or converese something like that bookmark this shit all day.sources showing what exactly? 

more volume and frequency is better for hypertrophy, period. muscle protein synthesis stays elevated for 24-36 hours after a workout, 48 hours being generous but it really peaks around 36 and the window gets shorter the more well trained you are. so if you are working out a muscle only one day a week that means there are 5 days a week where your body is not building muscle there. so why would you want to hit a muscle group any less than twice a week? also watch Pumping IronHahahah the best things ever man u missing outyoure not going to progress very much without volume.Is it possible for you to bike to work?I run over a rubber track section. I thought running on dirt is a lot harder due to uneven surfaces?Start slow, add more volume and exercises from there. Start off with a 3 day plan, there's tons of them out there. Try it with a narrow grip and you will immediately understandBecause "steroids" and "roids" and even "performance enhancing drugs" are all terms that carry a massive stigma. "Gear" is a term that is typically used almost exclusively in strength training circles that doesn't yet carry the same weight as the other terms. It's a safer word to use, if you will. Routine meals help so much. I do the same two every day and then mix it up for dinner, but that's a little more work. I have an optional ingredient for each of my two standardized meals that I can omit or include to accommodate whatever I'm having for dinner. i needed some HIP DRAHVE this morning thank you kind OPplenty of people low bar squat with a closed grip

5/3/1 has so little volume already i am not sure how you can take more outI had to cut back recently after i realized i was up to like 9 cups...that shit is anazing on cutsGood night sweet gainsIf you only just started working out, why are you giving out advice? 

Based on this comment, you don't even know when to do your own routine.I don't know why people seem anti salad here, maybe it's a gender thing, but I often do a good salad.  Just one bag salad, and all kinds of stuff in it from onions and celery to carrots and hard boiled egg. Just whatever you like.  To keep it from going off as I walk all over campus, I use an insulated lunch box and keep the liquid dressing seperate (usually just basalmic vinegar and olive oil with spices).  

If I've been hungry a lot carrots and hummus, or other veggies with hummus is real good for that.  Alternately, crackers and a good soft cheese like brie, goat cheese, and so on.  Dried fruit is also good for nibbling on.My (quite large) coworker had a phrase he always used about this exact thing... "It's always summer when you're fat."

Good job on the loss - keep it up!Op's got links though. I don't suppose there's a chance of Osgood Schlatter's disease?  Or an anatomical deformity? 

Drop the 3rd world squat, particularly if you have meaty calves and hams, and the physios recommended stopping them.  It can lead to levering apart of the femorotibial joint if too exaggerated.

Saying ATG is good for you is **broadly** true but a gross generalisation. 
(inb4 ignorance of human anatomy/biomechanics triggeered downvotes)


I have chronic knee pain, as in, more than half the day, every day.
Knee supports help, neoprene tends to keep them warm and therefore, decrease the synovial fluid viscosity.  I'm partly convinced some of the pain is due to the fact i've developed a habit of shaking/wiggling my knees while studying/bored, ending up with probably ~500 not-ideal motions per day in a not healthy mechanical movement.

You **could** try voodoo flossing, but it's hit or miss.  It's about hyperaemia to essentially "flush out" inflammatory debris.  No idea whether it's applicable in this case, beneficial or even harmful, but it'll be worth reading up on it and deciding.

I'm not sure whether terminal knee extensions are contra-indicated or beneficial, but check it out.


One of my lecturers told me glucosamine doesn't actually help, but i'm not sure.  

Good luck broski, hopefully you don't end up like me!Thanks, giving that a download as we speak and I'll watch it late today.

Appreciate the advice, too. I think I would be more comfortable cutting the weight off first, and then, as you put it "lean bulking into eternity".
When benching you want to activate everything. Pecs, delts, triceps, lats, legs. This with a propper arch will let you bench more weight, safely.I hope you have a grippy shower mat!Trap bar is easier. So no, keep doing straight bar. What a whaleAlso, if the onset of the knee pain coincides with your back injury, that's pretty indicative.

Helpful to know what the 3 different physios all said too.I boil some chicken breast in water, toss it with some salt and spices (paprika, some Indian spices), throw it in a tortilla and add some lettuce and onions. It comes to about 40g of protein and 300 or so calories. I just started doing this, making five and rotating them from the freezer every day. I add a small bag of chips and a Quest bar, and that's lunch.I have to continually remind myself that I will likely never be in the same shape I was in before my nerve damage, and that's ok.

Everyone I know now didn't know me back then. I'm the only one comparing myself to what used to be. Everyone now is comparing me today to me yesterday. They see improvement. They see mobility. They see how it impacts my life. 

I have to tell myself to see what they see, and that what they see IS fit, in shape, muscular. It's no where near where I was 5 years ago before the wheelchair, before the cane, before all the nerve studies. They don't care about that. 

They care about what they see here and now, and if they're seeing improvements and positive change, then I need to be happy and accept. (Sorry to ramble)Fitness is not a sport tho.I have started going into the gym first thing in the morning.  Roll out of bed and off to the gym.

Mornings are so much easier for me. Could you go at 5 to be at work by 6.  Is that a possibility?Lie on the floor like you're doing a Plank, but rest your upper legs on the foam roller. Roll yourself back and forth over the upper legs but don't roll over or past the knee. If you want a deep roll, balance yourself with all your weight on one quad and roll back and forth. 

This shit daily, fixed my apt in a heartbeat.Put in a packet of that taco seasoning powder stuff. It's magic.Bird-dog, glute bridge are probably superior tbh, I recall Bret Contreras reporting that anyway.

In fact, just read Bret's work.  He's called the Glute Guy for a good reason.


If you're dead set on doing single leg, Bulgarian Split Squats, reverse lunges.

Lack of fiber.The man clearly knows his shit but I don't like the loquacious approach he seems to favour. It's like he's got a bullshit baffles brains mentality going on, throwing around tons of unnecessarily complex kinesiology terms and theories. 

Always found Alan Thrall to be more helpful. Oh also, obviously, all the glute iso exercise in the world is useless if you don't really **try** to feel the glutes and develop good mind-muscle connection/motor patterning.Bobo go gym, Bobo accelerate mass against gravity.

Yeah so I woke up this morning at home for break. Thinking about my struggling grades and undergraduate career, my rough patch with one of my best friends, and about the molar aching in my mouth but I did some pullups, some pushups and started thinking about that coffee date and the confidence I had that day and for some reason I felt huge, thick, and happy…………[so of course I took some pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/Z5E20)Stop thinking.

Where they have their legs far forward and use the smith's vertical bars sliding up and down to stabilize?

I saw a guy in the squat rack in this position, getting ready to unrack. I thought he was stretching or something odd, but yeah he unracks, starts tumbling backwards and almost fell over.

You MAY be cold due wrecking your metabolism by dieting and/or over restricting your food intake. This is why I was so cold. I'd start with yoga. It will allow you to get some peaceful time before bed, but will challenge you and strengthen muscles you never use.Not in my shower they can't. That wouldn't work. I push against the wall in front with my toes, while my feet are flat. In order for my knees to pass my toes, i would have a weird stance, and i would also have to take my back off the wall, which really would defeat the whole purpose of doing it in the shower.

Each recipe lasts two two weeks (freeze one week and take down the Saturday before you need it) and takes minimal prep/cook times.  Pack in Tupperware of you're choice and it's a simple grab and go in the mornings.  Plus keep hot sauces at your desk/cubicle/office for extra flavor.Stop counting your gym as calorie burning.. your exercise should already be counted for when you calculate TDEE. 
I've got a fiber supplement. I mix it with yoghurt and it helps me to 'keep things moving'. And normally it would cause me to visit the small room once per day. But after that big meal I haven't been there for 3 days. 

Do you still think it has to do with lack of fiber?I hate using the stride runner.

One time, I was doing cardio on it and close to the end of my time, I noticed a girl get on to the runner two down from me. She is someone who I used to know and had some conflict with when I knew her. So, naturally, when my time was up, I wanted to get off as soon as possible.

I went to step off, and the lip on the pedals tripped me and I fell forward and almost smashed my face into the barrier between the cardio equip and the lifting machines. 

I was embarrassed and walked away. 

That was not the first nor the last time I've tripped getting off of the stride runner, but it's the most memorable.

I hate you, stride runner.Probiotics may help with digestion. I know Evan Centopani, pro-bodybuilder, is a huge supporter of probiotics to help aid digestion. Nah, 5am to 7pm work days usuallyIs there any particular reason why you do squats like this?http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Deadbugs+exercisei do that in the smith machine to stretch out the hamy OHP primarly uses the anteior delts to move the weight. Other muscles in the shoulder and rest of the body stablise the weight. [Rear raises put your muscle at an extreme disadvantage.](http://imgur.com/nhm3r5W) Your rear delts are also smaller weaker muscles.Everything you have said shows you have a lack of understanding about squats. 

Im also not sure what your askingseriously? you're gonna be passive-aggressive because he didn't link up to something that can be googled in 5 seconds?

How fucking spoiled people really are today? Strength loss starts to happen at about 2 weeks of inactivity. I'd at least keep muscles activated with body weight exercise if you can.

I recently was pretty sick for a couple weeks and couldn't lift, but the biggest issue was I also couldn't eat. I lost 6 pounds. I've been good for 2 weeks now, but I am at 95% of my strength pre-sickness, and have only regained 2 pounds so far.Get some metamucil or benefibre and get r doneBodyweight squat progressions are more than sufficient and will give you fairly muscular legs.

Also good luck with school and best friend and molar!That's something I've had problems with.  Do I just squeeze them during the exercise?The most important thing should be that you are seeing linear progression with your "strength" lifts....as long as some high-rep/endurance work doesnt interfere with that then sure it cant hurtthank you.You could use one of [these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dildo).

I am filled with an intense passion to help others to do the same. I became a Fitocracy coach over the summer, and have been helping others lose weight through sustainable habits. I've also started to blog about it, but I don't have much of a following yet. My blog is http://www.chuckgrossfitness.com and my facebook page is https://www.facebook.com/chuckgrossfitness I also submitted my story to CNN.

On Fitocracy, I usually run 2 distinct courses: 
Extreme Fat Loss, a group course which is habit focused lasting 8 weeks. A new course started on March 1st. Spots are almost full and I'll be closing signups tomorrow!
https://www.fitocracy.com/team-fitness/430/extreme-fat-loss/

Massive Fat Loss, a group course specifically for the obese/morbidly obese person with some weightlifting experience or willing to try. The dietary portion is based on low carb/keto/carb cycling.

I also offer 1 on 1 private coaching through my website, http://www.chuckgrossfitness.com 

I welcome any feedback or questions! Thank you for reading!There is slight difference between saying removes most of involvement and removes all involvment. Your calorie intake depends on your body weight, activity level, etc. You want to eat a bit above your TDEE to gain muscle and not too much unneeded weight. Everyone's TDEE is different.enchilada sauce is my guessJim got me through undergrad. Jim is a great guy. Jim will never leave Bobo.Right, so I've (m16) been gyming for almost 2 months now. Today was a great session... but:

- Walk into the gym, checking a bench is empty and receive a death stare from some guy for way too long

- Some guy walks behind me while I'm doing a sort of tricep skullcrusher thing, with one dumbbell. I leave my hands in the extended position so he can pass and he just starts showing me how i should be doing the excercise, moving my hands around on the dumbbell and telling me what to. He ends up showing me a pec excercise and after that i explain i was looking for triceps, (foreign country so I didn't understand so much and i didnt know how to say tris so i just pointed), and then he tells me to use 2 dumbbells for it and watches me for a few setsI am not even sure which it is. Thank you for asking. I have another question for the doctor. To guess, I think it atrial. He said that chamber is a bit thickened. With that, can you add to my prognosis? Thank you so much!Great time to explore /r/bodyweightfitness (come to the dark side)Do those ham curls one leggedHmmm, seems like a logical approach. Thanks for the idea!Wow that would suck.Bobo and jim be buddies.So i was doing squats yesterday, and i feel this tingling sensation in my buttocks. Mid squat i realise it's a little turd poking its head out.
At that moment I did what had to be done.
I dropped the bar and headed for the toilet



Lol jk of course i shat myself BUT i finished the squat AND my setSingle leg raised glute bridges kill my butt every time. Put one leg up on a stool or bench and you can either bend the other to your chest, hold it out straight or cross it over whatever you're more comfortable with and then glute bridge your hips up. You might have to try glute activation first to really get the "feeling" so look up some glute activation exercisesGood old hack squatsHow do you know this? Was there a study that showed core stability was best for fixing apt?I got it, no impact on my training. But there's over a thousand different arrhytmias, from what my doc said. It could have an impact for you, so hold off on heavy cardiovascular activity 
until you know what it does to you.Let's replace deltoid focused lift with traps focused one... Oh, /r/Fitness you never disappoint. 

Upright rows are safe if you don't try to show where the ceiling is with your elbows and load it with smaller weight that allows for 12-15 reps. Lateral delts love some volume instead of heavy weight.I don't have any goals for running. I really just do it because I like it. Ok. Friday or Saturday I will report here with much more detail. Thank you for taking the time.Why?It does and is what slowed Trunks down against Cell. Gohan did it right by going SSJ2 and went on to defeat Cell.

Educate yourself&gt; You have flexible shoulders and a 'weightlifting' user flair 

About that flair... Majority of 'weightlifters' here never attempted a snatch.It helps a scary amount... Based on Battle of Gods, If I get a God to bitch slap my girlfriend I will become unstoppable due to my rage. I'm just curious because I don't know much about Oly lifting yet, but what do you mean by "not by Oly standards"? What I always find helpful is *knowing* what the function of a particular muscle is.

For the glute maximus, it's all about *extending at the hip*, ie going from a bent over to erect straight body position.  (Other gluteal muscles do different things).  So squeezing **with purpose** is the main thing, not just squeezing.  I can tense my biceps all I like but without flexing them, I'm missing out.

Well done.

As a nobody on the internet, my opinion is if you start eating at maintenance rather than deficit and start doing some heavy 5x5 workouts while continuing your running, you're going to be one ripped BAMF in another 9 weeks. you would need a cerclage in the future, not kegals.Would be easier if videos weren't private.No quads on leg day?Thank you very much. It sounds as though these things can come damn near custom made. Do you have shortness of breath? I can tell an improvement just by being on Meds a couple days. I thought my shortness of breath before was from being out of shape.Haha thanks. I'm not, but I avoid meat when possible because I hate to support the farming industry. Hibachi chicken with fried rice and some sort of vegetables. Can all go together in one tub. You should post this in /r/loseit.

I just got the FitBit Charge HR last week and I absolutely love it. If you're someone who has a hard time staying positive about weight loss and fitness, I find it's a great tool for making you more excited and more optimistic to be healthy. Does your gym open up at 5?  Most gyms in my area open up at 6.  That's pretty awesome.That's awesome! It's a great program that I'm excited to see grow. Thanks!This is genius. Those are runnig shoes in the video, if i am not mistaken and the heels are very soft( for running that is perfect) but for squatting you want something that is hard, so flat shoes or weightlifting ones, you are a lot more stableI would just say thank you (or say nothing, it doesnt matter) and keep doing what you're doing. Using one arm for the exercise is perfectly fine Way to defend the guy doing exactly what you described.

He comes in here with this bitchy attitude, completely denying most of the great advice given regarding APT in this sub in a single arrogant post. Then he has people praising him for it? Who the fuck is this guy anyway to have the authority to negate the guides people have posted before and which have been received very well, some of which are included in the FAQ?

The fact is people on this sub seem to have "a real circle jerk" for arrogant quasi-authority figures shitting on the currently accepted routines. Yeah, regardless of whether this guy is right or not his attitude is shit and completely unnecessary.DL 3x5 and squat 5x5 back to back twice a week is going to be hard to keep up.  I'd drop it to DL 1x5 Squat 3x5Just remember, do YER FAHVESSide lunges yo. Get deeper in your squats perhaps? Also jump, jump, jump, jump and jump some more, chump.Haha, sorry. Fixed.Thanks for the pointers! I'll see if I can convince Balance to let me train on that 3-day pass, even though I'm not a resident (I'd pay, of course, but don't see that option).I was having some serious knee problems awhile back. Went to PT and discovered a ton of problems with my form which was leading to knee pain (worst of which being very minimal glute activation when I ran). Long story short, one of the things they had me do was switch to a forefoot strike style which helped with the knee pain but gave me some serious shin pain at first. They suggested wearing sleeves on my shins would help. This didn't make the pain go away, but it did help a lot. I no longer have that pain when I run, I suspect because my lower leg muscles have acclimated to my new mechanics.

You can go to any running store and just tell them you are getting some shin pain when you run, they will hook you up. If you have good insurance and it isn't cost prohibitive I highly suggest finding a good physical therapist to help you out. DO NOT try to push through pain you aren't sure about. I did that with my knees and ended up not being able to run for 6 months.Reformatting for you...

More often than not, working out is good for your heart but clearing it with a physician is the right plan.My lifting buddy got locked up this week, he missed leg day. Pretty bummed, I've been lifting by myself for a few years now and havin that spot and friendly motivation was really helping the gains. Free Ben!Can't read it.  What does it say?Yep.

Does your fiber supplement look like giant strings of celery? Nope? Ok.

You should really re-think your relationship with veggies; they're good for you.

Also, could probably also drink a bit more water. :-)1600/1300 kcal - thats low.

Make sure you get a very thorough checkup, it's very calming to know exactly what you're dealing with onwards.I'm just wanting to know if this way of doing it is even practical. 

I know, it's out thereThank you! I didn't know that sub existed!In push-ups the scapulae are free moving, whereas in the bench they're fixed. You have to make sure to avoid impinging the rotator cuff in the bench because of that.Looks great.  Maybe consider alternating 3x5 and 4x8/3x10 on deads and bb rows.  If your working sets are both 100% all out 3x5 it could get a little taxing.

The leg day looks good.  Depending on how well you handle the volume I would add leg extensions and some sort of other hamstring work like SL deads or one legged deads.Got asked to spot someone for the first time in my life from a guy who I've always thought was pretty well built. I know it sounds stupid but it felt like some kind of validation for all the progress I've made.

Also went grocery shopping right after gym and shrugged 2 shopping bags all the way to the parking lot. Probably looked like an idiot but haters gonna hate. (Bonus cause it was shoulders day)Robo happy for Bobo. Robo hope best for Bobo and girl.I saw a girl (probably like 11-12ish years old) doing standing rows with the cable machine, while bracing herself by standing at a 45-degree angle  (away from the cables) on one of those balls.

I hope that was descriptive enough. I'd make a shitty MSPaint diagram if I wasn't so lazy.You say nine weeks in the title and three months in the post, which one is correct? I squat plenty deep, I just use my quads exclusively to stand up.  I'll check out the side lunges though.Wheymen, brother.The post was edited. When I answered it said 'removes the anterior delts from motion'.Thats strange with the squats ive never experienced that. Tellin you though, side lunges. See I thought the idea was to keep protein synthesis high in order to gain muscle. Muscle also grows from other calorie intakes as well?How did you know you left it there? Did you do it intentionally? And we're you doing curls in the squat rack?I sometimes do bicep curls with the shopping bags so that probably looks even weirder than shrugsIts the title of the picture but it says "I dont always lift at the gym, but when I do I don't use the smith machine"Saw this cuntmuffin use two [triceps ropes](http://finerfitness.ca/ffitness/folderForImages/283l[1].jpg) tied together to make his form even worse. Not that big of a gym and the ropes are always in demand, but this twatbucket couldn't give two shits and completed like 5 sets with thorough rests between. Worst thing is, we HAVE longer ropes laying around... 

Had it been my tri-day, I'd sure give him a real stink eye.
My usual caloric intake is in the ballpark of 1500 per day. Which is one meal per day for me.Chicken breast is expensive in the UK. Plus I like to buy free range or not at all so tend not to buy it. Alternatives I have are:
Turkey if I can find free range- cheaper than chicken here, it's not that popular.
Eggs. Superfood! Boiled and left in the shells until I want to eat them.
Tuna. Either tinned or grilled and marinated overnight with some chilli.
Salmon or a smoked fish, prepared the same as tuna.
Have the protein mixed in with a leafy salad to make it feel more like a meal.
Crudités of broccoli, tomato, apple in a Tupperware box to pick at throughout the day so I can graze. 
Brown rice (yawn)
Cous cous - slightly less protein but lower carb and so quick to cook. Very versatile for mixing with stuff Been there and done that! Welcome to the crisp and clean hygiene life.Gym routine currently consists of 5X5 saltines, gatorade, chicken soup, sleep, emails to professors asking for extensions. Fuck mono.As long as you can jumprope and do like 10 push-ups you already have enough body strength to start.I've never pushed more weight than I have with this program.  I wouldn't use dumbbells of any sort for chest. Stick with barbell for bench and incline presses.

Also, stick with OHP and switch to Arnold when you stall.[AND THEN THEY ALL JUST LEFT THEM THERE.](http://imgur.com/A1RsmL3) #freeben2015Good shit broWelcome to the club! You are now ready for a life full of heavy weights and poops in your pants!Last week while I was doing dips this guy came over and started doing cable pull downs in front of the dip station. He was wearing what looked like silver minimalist shoes that caught my eye, so I checked them out between sets and realized they were soccer cleats. Dude was wearing soccer cleats for arm day. 

I wanted to ask if he accidentally brought the wrong bag and decided to workout anyway, but he wasn't dressed for soccer so I left it alone.Does this stuff work anyway if you are sitting all day?Check out the leangains calculator.

You're not alone!I love all of those things, but I never remember to pack them for lunch.It's a smith machine though A.K.A. the peasant machineAny lift can be dangerous if you're stupid enough to do it with shit form.This is pretty much my only optionI've always been confused by the smith machine. I'm a noob still. Does it get used for squats? My gym doesnt have a squat rack. Your body will gain muscle when it has a surplus of calories, which is why many people will bulk. You want to keep protein high, or roughly .6-.8*body weight (or lean body weight) in order to maintain the muscle development you have. So yeah, eating 2700-3300 will likely help you build muscle, but if it is well above what your recommended TDEE + 500 cal is then a good amount of it will be fat. Check out [this TDEE calculator](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) to get an idea of what your TDEE is, then add about 500 calories to help bulkI'm quite happy with my squat numbers so I've never had a reason to try and fix the problem.  I'll give them a shot today.  Do you do them with a kettlebell? BW? DB?How did you get your abs to show? I've been cutting for forever now, but I still can't see abs. jesus christ at least label it NSFWHow does it reheat? I've always been scared to eat leftover fish.Candito did a video on this subject if you want to watch it.Not really, since OP is not allowed to lift heavy and I doubt that it matters whether the weight comes from iron or from your body.A really weird thing happened to me at the gym yesterday. So I am doing some reasonably heavy squats in one of the racks, and a little guys comes up to the rack next to me and punches out some hi rep 60kg half squats (maybe three quarter squats). He finishes and takes off to the leg press machine a little further down. 

Then this gym regular, a big tank of a guy, who I have never talked to before comes over to me when I am resting and says something to the effect of "these half squat guys are such a joke, they think that they can load up the bar, bend a bit at the knee and they will get the results that you are getting".

At this stage I think "ok this guy is giving me a nice complement" and I smile and say thanks. But he keeps saying pretty much the same thing, but now I realise he is speaking very loud and keeps looking over at the little guy on the leg press, like he is trying to call him out. I am starting to feel uncomfortable so I just keep smiling and say "I just keep out of it, I don't say a thing when people half squat". Which is true, but it is mostly cause I have no interest in interacting with them as opposed to me not being judgmental. The big dude eventually moves on and talks to another big dude, still complaining. 

I just chalked it up to him not having a volume control and it being a complement to me so I could move on and not dwell on it, but it was a very strange encounter. I admit I am a bit of an arsehole internally, I just don't understand the desire try to call someone out like that. Hopefully, I was misreading the situation.I prefer to log my activity on something like runtastic, which has a bigger, more refined database of activities. But I don't ever really use it to adjust my calorie intake unless I'm drastically more active than normal or if I'm losing too much weight or feel drained, etc. I think using activity tracking to adjust intake could be more useful while trying to bulk up. 

I recently got a Fitbit Surge, and that's been really helpful in terms of how my activity level and caloric needs change on the daily. It syncs with MFP really nicely.&gt; This shit daily, fixed my apt in a heartbeat.

Just curious about the time scale, does that mean 2 weeks, 3 months?...If you get what you need, including trace (micro) nutrients, then yes you can. Babies manage to live and grow on only milk for quite a long time. 2 spoons of coconut oil, cleans me right out!Yea....I recently took up the heavy bag again.  You're not going to get in to shape over night.  Walk when you're tired and start breathing heavy.  Let your heart rate come back down a little and then start jogging more. Hell....you might want to start with walking for a few minutes THEN start jogging just to warm up.  Don't push it to the max on day one. Take that 1 to a 2. then that 2 to a 3, and so on.  Before long you'll make your own rhythm and the longer you do it the less you will notice and the better you will feel.

Something like barbell hip thrusters would be a good idea.Cable fly machine is broken. Sign on the machine says please do not use. Take the opportunity to use that free space to do deadlifts. Get dirty looks from some lady because she doesn't have enough room to use broken machine.

I mean yeah normally it'd be a dick move taking up that space but I figured no one would use a broken machine right? Nah, tons of people just ignored the sign and just used it anyway. At least the gym wouldn't be liable if they hurt themselves.I am almost in the same boat. I work 6 to 5-7 Monday to Friday,  installing 10 mm shower doors. So it is physically draining humping around glass all day. When I get home I am exhausted as well but I bought a few kettle bells, and just do a small routine almost everyday after work and it was worked wonders for me. Also cutting most sugar and possessed food. You will feel wat better in the end

&gt;Edited spelling


Stitches are just the worst. They stop me right in my tracks even if I have been running smoothly for a while, then suddenly, bang, stitch.

In terms of breathing (please note I am not a professional in any way, this just works for me) 

- Posture is really important. Straight back and try to open up your chest as much as you can, let your lungs fill as much as they can with air. 

- Try to keep your arms moving front to back not crossing over in front of your chest. I pretend that there is a bar running from wrist to wrist stopping them from creeping in.

- Keep your head up just a bit. Not looking to they sky, just don't let your chin drop.

- Make sure you don't put in more effort than you need to. Take long strides, not hundreds of little ones.

- Try not to twist when you run. Lots of people let their torso twist from side to side with their arms. Try not to do this. keep in all straight.

You might feel quite odd and rigid when you first run like this but it helps me run for longer and feel a little bit more like I know what I'm doing! 

A lot of this is seeing how you body needs to work, in terms of getting as much air into your lungs as you can. When you are running and your arms are crossing in front of your chest, your head tilted down and shoulders dropping forward you are closing up your lungs and airways. Try to keep it all open. 

If there is anyone out there that is a professional or anything close, please feel free to correct me on any of this, like I said, this just works for me.Seems rather heavy on the shoulders on push day, and rather light on the legs on leg day. 

I do worry about your rotator cuffs somewhat, given that you're not only benching (which works front delts), as well as doing arnolds &amp; OHP on the same day, but you're also doing face pulls the next day.

Personally if I were you I'd move deadlifts to leg day and throw in some abductor/adductor &amp; hip work as well. Maybe some box jumps and calf raises also if you want to build up explosiveness. I think many people underestimate just how strong their lower bodies can become.
"Cut" which is the opposite of typical McSugar BBQ sauce.Bigger, deeper breaths in through your nose; out with your mouth. When you feel the stitches coming, you should feel like you are trying to breath the world in, in each and every breath. Eventually, you and your body will find a breathing rhythm that suits you well. When doing HIIT like sprints, it's multiply short breaths as fast as you are moving your legs. Same as before, in through the nose, out of the mouth. Hope this helps. If it matters, I run 2-3 miles a day, 6 days a week. With 2-3 of those days being sprint miles. &gt;This is another point in favor of taking your creatine just after your workout for getting the most of it.

I'm not sure I read it that way: 

&gt;There was an increase over time for lean tissue mass and muscle strength and a decrease in fat mass (p&lt;0.05). CR-A resulted in greater improvements in lean tissue mass (? 3.0 ± 1.9 kg) compared to PLA (? 0.5 ± 2.1 kg; p &lt; 0.025). Creatine supplementation, independent of the timing of ingestion, increased muscle strength more than placebo (Leg Press: CR-B ? 36.6 ± 26.6 kg; CR-A ? 40.8 ± 38.4 kg; PLA ? 5.6 ± 35.1 kg; Chest Press: CR-B ? 15.2 ± 13.0 kg; CR-A ? 15.7 ± 12.5 kg; PLA ? 1.9 ± 14.7 kg; p &lt; 0.025). Compared to resistance training alone, creatine supplementation improves muscle strength with greater gains in lean tissue mass from post-exercise creatine.

Both CR-A and CR-B performed better that the Placebo, but I don't see CR-A and CR-B compared to each other?...unless there is more to the article! I'm on mobile right now. 

As for your potential issue with taking creatine in conjunction with caffeine, examine has a link to a study on that. What the fuck is your beef with America? And if you think any make and cheese is a good meal for someone trying to lose weight your delusional.&gt; SquatsI saw a confrontation at the gym last Saturday. One guy attempted to throw a 45lb weight at the other. Luckily he didn't hit him and it got broken up. Protein shake, mini yogurt (100 to 140cal), random veggies, mini cheese (maybell, etc) (80 to 140 cal), apple or banana (not high amounts of fructose, but high amounts of vit b, potassium, mag)What is a stride runner? The elliptical?I don't know which is worst...27 male 5 11" and currently 163 lbs. Been working out for about 2 years (lost 40lbs) and been lifting for about 7 months. Current stats bench-160 squat-225 OHP-105 and deadlift-285. Just starting to track my food and still can't decide to cut or bulk. I really want a 6 pack and more definition but also would love to improve my numbers so any suggestions or critiques would be greatly appreciated :) 
http://imgur.com/uCHLwuP http://imgur.com/VXuzG4ZMy university's gym doesn't have a ton of stuff. Honestly, it's way too small for the student body. Two power racks + an Olympic platform are all you get for squats, deadlifts, etc, and there are somewhere around 17000 students. 
Well, some asshole was circuit training Stronglifts on the squat/ohp/deadlift day. He had one power rack (for his squats) and the platform, which he was using for ohp. At 75lbs.  
Why all the rage? He wouldn't let anyone work in on either. I was trying to get in on the platform, and another dude I know wanted to squat.  

I got a little satisfaction out of the fact that he got one (and shit it was ugly) rep on a 200lb deadlift, and couldn't even put it back. yeah sorry its 9 weeks. I dont know why I though March was over already haha You left dumbbells in the squat rack?You're doing a lot of tricep work. 3 exercises in a row heavily focused on just those for 84 to 102 reps. I'd drop one of those exercises. Coolcicada only has two, and ends the push day with shrugs which you are totally lacking but imo probably isn't a huge deal. If you want another exercise for that day do some rear delt work like seated bent over db flyes.

Your pull day looks good. Deadlifts are going to tire you the fuck out though, especially if you consider the warmup sets to get to your working weight. I'm in a similar boat and what I like to do is alternate starting with bb rows or deadlifts, so that my rows get some time in the spotlight as well. For the curls, consider some reverse db curls alternating with the hammer curls. Helps target the different parts of your biceps.

Legs you've got targeted hamstring work but nothing for your quads. Why did you drop leg extensions? You should do those or another quad dominant exercise like lunges. You're also doing a lot of calf exercise in a single day. While I'll applaud you, good luck walking the next day. If it's too much for you, consider alternating between standing/steated. Personally I also like to do rack pulls on leg day for something to target glutes.

Keep in mind the general idea here is a compound main exercise with low rep and high weight, followed by several accessory lifts targeting each individual muscle group with lower weight and higher reps. Don't just drop an exercise without adding something to replace it or you'll end up with weird imbalances.I work out at the Y, and there must be a senior's swimming class or something at the time I'm usually there, because at least a couple of times a week this dude who's well into his eighties makes his way butt-ass naked across the locker room with his walker.  It seriously takes him a full 60 seconds to walk 15 feet.  I noticed once that in the time it took me to come in, get changed, and leave, he had managed to put on one sock.  I think of him every time I don't feel like going to the gym because it's a hassle or I'm tired or sore.  If he can do it, I have no excuses.Op could you ask your doctor about recommendations for people dealing with hypertension and lifting weights? I've been doing squats for a few weeks now and I've gotten into heavier weights(for me at least) and now every time I'm finished, my hips and inner thigh are killing me. Anyone have an idea why that might be? I'm assuming form?Bobo give thanksI saw some lady doing pushups on the smith machine bar. Pushups. And then when someone asked her if he could use the machine for presses, she says "no, I'm using it." No one should be using the smith machine for any exercise anyway, but I thought it was pretty funny to watch it all play out.You're so fucking awesome. DAE hate the Smith machine? Amirite?CrossFitters attempting to use weightlifting equipment at my gym. Of course they didn't put anything away and used everything incorrectly. Sorry, but the leg press isn't meant to be used to train chest...Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

So it's me and him in the dumbbell section, I'm just curling my twenties trying not to stare at the veins in his calfs. Dude is huge. So ya I guess you could say we're pretty much bff now. Could they have been spinning shoes? They kinda look like cleats but maybe he was in a spin class and wanted to get some upper body work in as wellEating a variety of foods is usually better than eating the same thing. I'm sure protein cookie dough doesn't have all the nutrients like vitamin C and B as well as the fat soluble Vitamin A,D,E and K. And protein powders are seldom complete proteins. You would for sure be missing out on nutrients.It finally happened. Someone from /r/fitness got so pissed they actually ***threw a dumbbell*** at another gym goer. I thought it was just urban myth, but I guess the whispers are trueThanks for the explanation!I've done this. Came for answers.

My best guess is we just ripped it up too fast for the weight, not sure - but its a mistake I have only made once, lol.I want to get back under 200 and under 20% body fat.6 months after shoulder surgery and my max bench is back up to 300 lbs. Pretty pumped about thatIt's used for everything. Some people say it's bad for squats and I tend to agree. I'd never use it for squats. It can also be used for bench press, shrugs etc. It's purpose is to spot you and guide your movement So I work with this guy. We call him fluffy. He's the kind of person that takes every supplement he can, and is always talking about all the new supplements he taking, the T-boost, the creatine, his brand new protein. But he never works out, and every day is his "cheat day". Anyway, so we both have had kids in the last 9 months and somehow went from talking about babies to lifting. He tells me that he drinks his wife's breast milk for sweet sweet gainz. Yes friends. He was 100% serious. His wife pumps milk for their baby, and he drinks it because "look at how much it makes babies grow, im going to get so big". I cant make this up. I told him he was disgusting. I think he still does it. All my training became worthwhile. A drunk freshman grabbed my girlfriend, so I shimmied behind him, squatted down, cleaned him by his calves, and let go. I got about 10ft of distance with the toss.


Tl;Dr: caber-tossed a guy who grabbed my GF. Proceeded to dance.I moved into an apartment building last weekend that has a dinky lil gym. Everything is outdated, half the cardio machines are broke (not that I use em), and the padded floor tiles jut out here n there causing a tripping hazard but wholly shit is it nice to be the only one in there. I can play my music as loud as my lil phone's volume will allow, there is never any waiting for the bench, and it's been good enough to add some muscle on me last week. &gt;  My gym doesnt have a squat rack.

???Now is your chance for both of you to simultaneously get good at bodyweight fitness.You know, if you want to laugh at someone at the gym don't make eye contact first. It hurts you don't know everyone's story and if they are there they are trying to improve. 

I was a new years person this year. I say this year because I used to be in great shape, worked out religiously in the past. Played water polo, swam, and lifted. 

Shit happend in real life , I was in college and my mom got diagnosed with cancer. I am and always will be a mommas boy. Unforutnaley things never got better for her. I coped by setting everything of anything. Kept my high calorie intake from swimming but stopped working out. I went from 185 to 255 and I'm 6 ft 3. I've started and stopped again since then lost some weight gained some weight.

I've been continuing since January to go to the gym and swim, lift, and run 5 days a week now. I changed my diet to a healthy one and I now live a healthy life style like I use to. 

Its a struggle going from in shape to obese to attempting yo get back in shape. I'm down to 217 lbs. I don't always have time to hit the gym like I want to because of work but I go any day I don't work over 9 hours. I have never had this happen or frankly seen it happen ever. I got laughed at after I got up from bench because of how little I was doing. My headphones slid off my head when I got up so I could stand and I heard "only 65lbs and he is struggling " queue the laughter. This didn't come from the big jacked guys, they have always been really encouraging to me at my gym. It came from a 2 women, 1 of them an employee at the gym. It was the most crushing thing I have ever experienced anywhere. I had to leave and go sit in the shower because of how sad I was after.  There was no need to say that infront of me even if you didn't think I could hear. Do that in private away from everyone its rude and mean.

Tldr: I'm beating a dead horse in this sub, but please just be nice to people at the gym. Small things you do or say can really crush someone who was previously feeling really confident and good about himself.

I used a throwaway because I'm really embarrassed and friends know my real one.( formatting sucks I'm on a phone) 



4 training days is moderate carbs, mostly around your workout. 2 rest days of no carbs, and one training day, usually leg day, if high carbs. Specifics vary on your body type, etc. Also days can be different, such as high carb day, then each day goes down by 20 to 30 grams a day until u hit a zero day. 2 days high carb, one of which is a rest day then repeat the descending carb order The bar was not close enough to your body, and resulting in the overall motion resembling more of a Good Morning than it should have.

Try visualizing not pulling the bar directly up, but at a slight angle toward you.

I could be wrong, but I believe if your form had been ideal and it was simply a matter of ripping the weight up too hard, you would've smacked yourself behind your chin, either along your jawline or your neck.[For the obvious Quebecer. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvR6-SQzqO8)

I repost this all the time, but it's something Canadians need to see. Are you fucking joking? You must have a shit physique if you actually think it's only going to take 9 weeks for him to be a "Ripped BAMF". I'm not taking anything away from this dude but it takes years to build a solid physique mate.Google scoobyworkshop, experienced Guy who still pushes him self and looks awesome at a decent age.
He is a bit of a bodybuilder but the device is solid for longevity too.
Making your own path is crucial to make sure you can follow your own needs and make adequate decisions about your body's weaknesses to prevent injuries.
So many things in life will decide how you should workout and even the most proffesional personal trainer can only make guesses while you are the one with unique inside information about how your body. 
The person who best can tell you what steps you need to take to avoid injury is you!
Knowledge gives you the power to help yourself!

My tip would be to focus on a healthy diet and an medium amount of bodybuilding and cardio for longevity in strength of the body and the heart giving you a long and healthy life. Avoid sports and above average strength and endurance goals, sure they can be healthy but often lead to not listening to your own body and getting injured. 
Also make an effort to start slow and read up on form!Have this problem with my 3D graphics work and have not dealt with it yet - but I should be doing cognitive behaviour therapy. You are catching the weight on your shoulders and chest, get your head back like you are doing an OHP. My recommendation:

I prefer a dedicated shrugs exercise myself, might think about throwing that in. Same deal with leg extensions.

I'd also recommend your pull-ups before your barbell rows.

Think about adding in some flyes, you can do a flye exercise in place of one of those three (!) triceps exercises you're doing.

Overall I'd recommend just evening things out a bit more. Some muscle groups you're only exercising or isolating once, and others (biceps, triceps, upper back) you're isolating three times in addition to compound exercises.

Finally, I haven't tested it myself but when I posted my work-out a lot of people recommended I don't do deadlifts and legs on consecutive days... either split your pull and leg days, or move deadlifts to leg days. I also made that switch last week so I can't say how well it works for me just yet, but it was a common recommendation.9 cups? Can you see sounds after that much caffeine?Yeah, I was a bit confused by that. Only a smith machine. He's trying for strength, not aesthetics, bro.I think that you should increase the set volume. Im not sure if you would already have done this, but at least for your big lifts (bench, squat, deads), throw a few sets in to work up towards your 'working sets' weight, then do the 3 working sets, or even more. I think the best way to gain mass is to try to go heavy, and to get heavy you need to add a few lighter sets in there as you work up. For the stuff after that, less volume is fine. 

Also, maybe throw some goodmornings in as an alternative on deadlift day. Some cable chest work on push day. Front squats, split squats, bulgarian squats, walking lunges, step ups, all sorts of other things on leg day. Its important to keep the program changing slightly. 
This morning there was an older Asian man in a golf shirt and jeans doing flyes with 2.5 lb weights. About 10 minutes after I walked into the gym, he looked at me dead in the eyes and dropped them on the ground (to assert dominance...? I dunno). He then walked over to the leg press and did that for about 5 minutes, then went and did 4 chin-ups and left.

It was all very confusing.There is a concept in the fitness world called body recompositioning that allows one to burn fat and build muscle at the same time. While I know next to nothing about it besides diet cycling, you could look it up yourself. I think that may be what happened here? &gt; I'm considering doing P/P/L twice a week with one rest day - is this too much?

Nope. Resolutioner chiming in here.

Been running 2x PPL splits per week since Jan 1, with the rest day reserved for auxiliary work.

Went from 204 to 180, and have achieved bulging bicep/quadricep veins and noticeable pec vascularity as well.

Added ~ 25 lbs to flat bench, ~ 45 lbs to incline, ~ 90 lbs to squat, and ~ 120 lbs to DL.

This shit *works*.Only one thing can be said to this.  Why?Less of a gym story, more of a fitness-related facebook story.

Friend of mine has always been fat. Started crossfit like 6 months ago or something. At least he's doing something, right? I'm cool with it. He's going regularly and seeing progress, I'm happy for him. All of a sudden I see an update of his saying 'muscle up, almost there'. HOLY SHIT! That's crazy, congrats. Then he posts the video... dude is rocking back and forth like he's gonna triple summersault out of there, with a trainer helping his movement and then he tries to go up, the trainer pushes him up as well and he doesn't make it. 

Dude. Please.

Anyway, I'm still happy he's exercizing.I'm sure you guys have that one old guy that walks around the gym and talks to *everyone*, right? I remember when I first started out, my gym had that old guy that gives advice and talks to everyone and wears a punisher skull sweater. He came up to me once and said "look here boy. This is how you do this workout. I can make your chest so big girls would be licking your nipples"

I was like "uhhh" &gt;___&gt; Nature's cut. Embrace it bro I usually time my breaths to my running cadence. For easy runs I usually breathe in for 4 steps and out for 4, then adjust according to how I feel. Another tip that I found helpful is to breathe from your diaphragm, so rather than inflating your chest focus on inflating your belly. Basically just focus on getting deep breaths if you feel a stitch coming on.You will not accidentally get huge.

Eat at calorie maintenance and you wont grow.Keep up the good work! Anything you are doing is better than sitting on the couch. But I do want to add that you can/should do abs more than once a week. Even if it's 5 minutes worth. At the end of your walk, do some stretching and include a few planks and mountain climbers. Some people said not to worry about cardio at first, but I personally think cardio makes the biggest difference in my emotional state/happiness level, so adding the cardio will make you feel better about yourself because of the endorphins. So I´ve been pushing hard the last few weeks, and feeling awesome doing it. However, yesterday I started squats at 40kg, warmups.. 
Pulled my back at the second rep. FML. been sitting infront of the computer all day, not really helping my lifts.. 
Not really a story but needed to get that out there. Finally switched off of my beginner linear progress routine this week and moved over to Coolcicada's P/P/L split. My first pull day was Thursday and my biceps are still feeling the DOMS this morning. It's glorious, it has been so long since I've felt DOMS.Need diagram.He could do some of the easier, assisted progressions, maybe, a la levels 1-2 of Convict Conditioning?I have added two exercises to my ab workout which might of helped. I've been doing hanging leg raises and the next one I'm not really sure what its called but its a renegade press up will then you move the weights forward (this is where I first saw it at 2.24 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ). Although I'm aiming to make my abs a lot more visible over the coming weeks. Because running shoes aren't flat and compress under weight, making an unstable platform, it's a problem especially when the weight gets heavy.yea i was walking into work with multiple coffee travel mugs, i really have to figure a way to get halfway decent coffee at workYou can squat on a smith machine, honestly I'd say it's a lot of preference. You obviously don't have to stabilize the bar and balance with the smith machine, but you're still getting the main squatting motion. It's used for all kinds of things, I use it for shrugs, bent over rows, upright rows, etc.I found out it is a much more enjoyable thing to schedule upper body workouts on Tuesdays and Thursday as the benches are nearly empty. After some more research, I found out I am not unique in this opinion.Exrx.net may have options in their exercise directory.kHey guys about a month ago I started uploading my full workouts on YouTube. 

I've been lifting for over 10 years and am 100% natural. I want to inspire natural guys out there that you can get big without roids 

Check out my channel trailer 
http://youtu.be/qeA5EPIRpWw
Do I have to complete some weird offers before I can get my free Ben, or is it actually free?&gt; Now put some serious muscle on your frame and at 6'7"

Is it just me, or is it harder to get big as a tall guy? I'm not saying it's undoable, but it seems like it takes more work.You can to hit your macro but won't fulfill your micro This didn't happen in the gym but I gotta share it. Was at work and this chick I like comes up behind me to ask a question and grabs my bicep to get my attention. She was definitely feeling up my arms. Ahh yeaah. 
Anyway instant confidence booster.If you're doing dumbbell squats, try goblet squats. If you really want to get good glute activation, try barbell squats. When you hit proper depth and use hip drive, you'll feel it in your glutes. Stereo is much better.Meat, cheese, yogurt, fish, eggsAnother option is to run Pull/Push/Legs/Rest which always puts a day between the two.I fixed my anterior pelvic tilt and I can say that strenghening does NOT work at all. 

I've been working with a kinesiologist specialized in posture and she said that only stretching works and I have to agree with here. 

If you want the 3 basic stretches that have helped me overcome this problem just ask me. I'm in the same situation. Personally, seeing how much hate there is in this forum about smith machine squats, I don't do them at all and substitute for the leg press machine. I'm pretty sure I'm leaving some muscles uncared of but hey, I just hope deadlifts will train what's left, I do what I can.Started at a new gym about 4 months ago, and after a week this other new guy showed up. He was a bigger fellow, who looked and acted very new to the weightroom. We got to chatting and I gave him some pointers on good exercises and form, and he was in the gym every other day working out for 2 months. 2 months ago he just stopped showing up and I wondered where he'd gone, cose he was just making some good progress. 

Time passes and I kinda forget about him, and then 2 days ago hes back and hes lost a TON of weight. Dude looks really good!
He told me he lost a friend to a heart attack and that made him take a hard look at his diet and fix it. We're meeting up on Monday at the gym to start doing SL together!Yeah , I lift at 2 different Ymca's , they each have one squat rack , I squat 2-3 x a week , I've never ever seen anyone else using it. Ever . Also I've heard that using smith machine for squats  can be bad because it can make you conform to a non natural shape or motion , idk if that is accurate tho .Thank me later    
    
[Here](http://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/diagrams/sr-71diagram-02.gif)I click on this thread wanting to have a story, but I have a workout room at home so I have no gym stories :( So last night I'm doing squats, whatever. Next to me in the other rack are these two young women--cool, good on them. One of them was doing this really exaggerated OHP. I get that push pressing is a thing, but her feet were actually leaving the ground, making it a..jump press I guess? She actually said to the other one "You have to jump up!" as she was doing it.

A bit later I overheard a conversation between them, I'm not sure that it was in relation to this specific exercise, but:

Woman 1: "Is that a real thing?"
Woman 2: "Of course! You can do it, right? Anything you can do is a real thing!"

Deep, man. Deep.&gt; my lower back was getting worked waaaaay too much. So what I did was add deadlift to leg day and at first only do a couple doubles after my squats.

:D

I also moved DL to leg day because of this. My lower body hypertrophy shot through the roof as a result. Added like 40 lbs to my pause squat 1RM within 2 weeks.There's no spin at the gym so I never thought of that, but you could be right, he might have biked over and not brought other shoes.I hear ya. Just had my appendix removed. No weights for 6 weeks. Fuck my life right now. 

Netflix and Xbox One 5x5s.Well yeah, because you're leaning against a wall.What's with guys using the preach curl bench backwards?  Like instead of using the seat, they squat down on the side with the catches.  Is this a thing?The 45lb pound iron plate broke up in mid flight ?

That's some serious velocity. Guy must be a MLB pitcher. ;D
when do you know you should go back when your abs are weak ? Made a new friend at the gym yesterday. He looks like he was sculpted by the Brodin himself - 6'3" tall and 210 lbs of pure muscle. And that's just the beginning. He was a rower since he was 9 years old and the first time he got into a gym was at the age of 14. apparently their coach wanted to see how strong his team was. My new bro benched 2 plates. He benched 2 fucking plates the first time his hands wrapped around the cold, metal bar. This guy is an inspiration for me from now on.Drink some coffee.I don't necessarily have anything against pants and sweaters. I wear pants for work everyday. I find shorts, even khaki shorts, to be more comfortable. 

When I go outside somewhere in the cold weather, most places (with the glaring exception of movie theaters) have the heat going. Sure, I'm out in the cold for a couple of minutes, but then I'm comfortable and not having to ditch layers. If it's windy, it sucks, but it makes that sweet first step into the warmth that much better. 

As for sweaters, I've never really been a big fan. I have a couple that I wear to work, but they aren't my first choice.I think he's using two arms, but one dumbbell.Yeah, pretty much. But the gym I go to has an elliptical that's called a stride runner or something like that and it pulls your feet back and forth, pretty parallel to the ground, while the actual "elliptical" pulls your feet in a circular motion.

The stride runner at my gym moves like [this](http://i03.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/prodfull/proform-smart-strider-pro-spacesaver-elliptical-d-20131231125607777~313600_alt1.jpg) and the elliptical moves like [this](http://www.fitnessblowout.com/images/Products/Enlarge/strider_fs56.jpg).

Whatever. I hate them both.My gym suspends memberships to people who do that.  NSFG NOT SAFE FOR GAINS When my college roommate got Mono, his body underwent nature's bulk, sans muscle.Smith machine is actually pretty great for progressing pushup variations and inverted rows.Tall people have bigger frames so they need to put on proportionally more muscle to look big.  So yeah, I would say it is more difficult, but their strength ceiling is higher.  Most people act as though its stupid to  have nice gym apparel  but I love it.  I am NOT a person who likes to go work out, but having nice things helps.  Nordstrom Rack is my favorite place to shop.  Typically i can get the 90 dollar Nike running pants for 35.  Thats about my limit.  I dont like to pay more than 15 or 20 for tops but i will shell out for good pants and jacketsThe low-bar squats is what I'm referring to when I say I don't use my glutes.so, wait, are you recommending elbows be flared out or not?

&gt; elbows flared out while pressing and everybody is happyAlways shit before you squatAlways shit before you squatFinally getting into my 5 day/week routine that I had planned, but usually wasn't able to complete because of school or work or whatever. Anyway I'm going there often enough that the gym staff recognize me and just let me through if I forget my card to scan in. It's a good feeling.Good for you. Funny that we look forward to DOMS, like pain is the reward. If it aint broke dont fix it, right? Honestly you can change it up. I get the straight curl bars typically. Put that bad boy on my shoulder as usual. Kettle bell i would do if you wanna hold it in front of you. The dumbbell in though i found working my groin more. Possibly because the were hanging down low. I like to get like spider man with mine, so i prefer either a bar on my shoulders or holding the bell in front.Two stories today:

1. While doing my SL5x5 warmup in the squat rack, I had my headphones in but wasn't playing any music yet. I go to squat 95lb for my second warmup set when I hear two bros talking about how I should get out of the rack because I only had 25lb plates on the bar. The rack next to mine opens up and the two bros jump in and start squatting 135lb then 185lb. I continue about my business and hit my PR working weight of 275lb. Bros next to me were 'mirin hard core. Don't judge a bro by his warmup.

2. Gangly bro I've been seeing at the gym consistently for a couple months now was in between sets on the flat bench. He had been struggling to put up 115lb for a while but was now repping 135lb. Huge bro repping 225lb next to him asked him for a spot. Gangly bro's face lit up like the Fourth of July.Straight out of [Pain and Gain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tktb___ZGw). This guy clearly wants to walk sideways through doors and shitBarring extreme obesity I seriously doubt OP is heavy enough for that to be an issue.Yeah that or just Push/Legs/Pull. Deadlifting the day after squatting is easier than squatting the day after deadlifting.Bro Tip: Use some of [Dom's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6hY08jDyAA) tips for more bonus gains.facking hell, need a bit of http://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/ after thatDon't sweat it, man. It's always important to check your ego at the door and do what you came to do. That means disregarding what others may think or say. Just keep making progress and improving. Ever had mashed cauliflower? It's awesome. Cauliflower really is an amazing potato substitute. People fanboy over routines? WowNo, but at my gym I periodically have to lift next to an older, normal-looking guy who always smells strongly of shit.No offense taken only lifting for 2 years starting out at 126 lbs. My size is not very good yet but I know that takes some time "I can't make this up" = "I made this up"Geez, how much were you squatting?  two turdy five?Your squat looks pretty good! You kept your weight on your heels in spite of your running shoes. I'd definitely recommend switching to converse or a pair of lifting shoes since the ones you're wearing will start compressing at slightly higher weight and throw your balance offI used to run with a guy who skipped running in the olimpics because his son was born on the day of the run . Anyways he's said to just keep breathing . Don't breath in with you nose and out with you mouth stuff . Relax every part of your body that doesn't help you run and breath.  He trained with a guy that ran with his jaw dropped all the time . He said he dint want to Burn energy in his face . Yup.  Commenting for laterhttp://i.imgur.com/Z7feNfS.jpg

You should steal their smith machine, and trade it in for a squat rack. You'll be doing the world a favor.The way he talks....I was convinced it's a novelty account.

I think Odin's sons were Thor, Baldr, Vidarr, and Vali. Not sure how you'd throw a bro-twist onto those names. Normally it would have never bothered me. I don't know what it was about them but it made me feel terrible.Then your gym is planet fitnessThen, wouldn't stretching the erectors between sets of abs/glutes/hamstrings be the right thing to do?My friend's wife told me breast milk tastes like melted ice cream.  Gross/delicious.Shit, you guys just brightened my day. I was feeling bad that I have two cups a day, now I'm looking at it as I "only have two cups a day."

Time to up that ante, baby!Sadly, I pretty much assume that unless they go out of their way to pick "Olympic Weightlifting" it's just another dude in his first month of doing SS/SL/ICF. It's something that will just happen. Adductors get slammed during squats, as does the entire muscular system within your hips. 

Unless this feels like a structural problem, I'd just keep squatting but throw in some mobility work to keep your hips loose(r).I moved across the country last month.

I finally found a gym I like this week. Close to work, not too busy when I go, enough squat racks, etc.

But going in is like walking into 1991. Everything is bright primary colors. Lots of basic geometric shapes on the wall. Van Halen and Dire Straits on the radio.i prefer to imagine it was a plate and not a dumbbellThe /r/JohnnyFire special:

1. Halfass your warm up, because it's Friday and you want to go home and play Smash Bros and drink sake and shit.

2. Make it through three sets of squats with so-so form, followed by doing a fourth set where you completely put all the weight on your left knee.

3. Fail fourth and fifth sets, stop for ten minutes feeling like a loser.

4. Return to workout, make sure knee is starting to feel better at this point and you've become refocused.

5. Begin deadlifting, remark how good your knee feels and how you think you can even add weight to go for a PR.

6. On your third rep of the PR, slam the bar directly into your knee.

7. Sit on an unoccupied bench looking like Peter Griffin holding your knee in pain.

8. Limp home wondering, despite the gym being near empty, just how many people saw that.Why do people make such a huge deal out of such stupid, menial crap? The timing of your coffee/protein intake will make 1/100th of 1 percent difference in your physique. Wouldn't the average tall person gain mass at the same rate as the average short guy? So that it would be just as easy for both of them but the mass gained would be relative and proportionate to their bodytype and size?Alright, I can understand that. Are you obese and/or have a history of knee injuries or stability issues? I ask this because generally speaking, if you can get up out of a chair without pain/losing balance, you can squat. And generally speaking, if you can squat safely, you probably should learn to squat since it has its distinct advantages.So yesterday at my uni gym this guy walks in and does single arm clean and press with a 90lb dumbbell. He was one of those guys that sounds like he's trying to go super saiyan when he lifts, which is annoying but whatever. But then when he's done he just chucks the weight to the ground. I'm not talking just letting the weight drop from the top of the lift. No, he literally throws the weight to the ground. The dumbbell bounces off the ground and hits a bench some other kid was sitting at. If the other kid was down doing something like dumbbell presses or skull crushers it literally would have hit him in the face. Then the dude just walks off. Seriously dude you're going to make a scene endanger other people and then not even rerack your weight? Pretty sure it was his first and only set too.You gotta [plug](http://graphics.condom.com/Images/400JPG/TAJ-BPLG_400.jpg) that shit up bro.Every gym has their "Shredded Bro". It's the guy who is always in the gym, over six feet, completely shredded, and always wears a tank top. Well, today I made eye contact with shredded bro and he did the upwards nod to me. I am also over 6 feet and trying to become a shredded bro.

Feels good man. Feels good. I've got OSD in one of my knees. I'm not obese, im 5 ft 10 in, 140 LBSI often hear colors and see sounds. Its not such a bad thing when you get used to it. Only takes me 4 cups to get that state though. :P&gt; this thread is ridiculous. chicken chicken chicken. So american.
&gt; While chicken is great, there are steaks, pork chops, ribs, fucking PULLED pork

For some reason steak, pork chops, ribs, and pulled pork for lunch seem a whole lot more stereotypically American than lean chicken breast. Eat my friend.... EatBobo no pee in pants?Congrats man. It seems I kinda have the same body style as your before picture. How did you manage to get rid of the pudgy part of your belly at the very bottom? Seems to be the hardest part for me to get rid ofTried deadlifts for the first time this week. My trainer has had me working up to it for a few weeks by learning correct form with powerbags and other stuff.  
My 1 rep max was 60kg - my body weight (I'm female).  
I was pretty pleased.What are they?Is that not an accepted way to do them too?

http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/DBTriExt.htmlmmm, that sweet boogie juice. One taste of that and you know why babies hate formula if they've already had that nipple nectar.  But, always get it straight from the source, it loses gainz in the fridge.    Nope, max is 3.meant im stalling at 175x5, stuck trying to get 180x5.Your deadlift looks good, the only thing I would suggest is work on your lockout. You might already have it right but I might not be able to see it as well.  You can do this by pushing your chest out once you've got the weight up.

Good job
Sounds super weird, but I kind of adopted a lamaze-style breathing pattern when I run. Three separate, quick inhales followed by one longer exhale. 

It isn't really based on anything, it just helped me to focus on breathing in general and keep my mind off the monotony of jogging. In reality, it probably helps because I *think* it helps. Any update on losing back fat or loose skin from your previous thread?There's a guy at my gym that I think is Chinese. He does countless sets of dumbbell bench presses and counts every rep out loud with a very thick accent. Eventually he'll get tired and do something else but the second he feels like his arms and chest are ready again, he'll go straight back to the dumbbells. Wears a Loony Toons t-shirt as well.

I also farted to day while putting down my deadlift. Hehehe.Checking in from the road currently, from what I understand of yoga, I think by the time I mentally prepared myself to try to relax I would end up asleep, I have a hard time relaxing muscle tension, and thought processes. I'm hoping I'm wrong on this, but I'm willing to give it a try, do you have any sources for beginners?Keep going to the gym. Keep losing weight. Keep getting stronger.

Eventually, you'll be attractive enough to ask the girls who laughed at you out on a date.

Pull out, hit her in the face, and then have a good laugh. Don't provide cab fare.

Sweet revenge.

( take it for what it is, words of encouragement )My gym looks like this everytime I go in. Its just a small unmanned gym in a village rugby club but still, its all we have so you think people would look after it.what the fuck is going on in this comment subdivision ._.YepLike that but lying down, don't see anything wrong with itPlus you've got a gear connection now too, which is always nice.God, I'm so sorry.  That's completely outrageous and it makes me furious.  Please tell the management.  They need and probably want to know about.  That woman deserves at least a reprimand, ideally a pink slip.

Also, kudos on getting back to the gym.  Hope this shitty person's shittiness doesn't deter you from going back.Sadly no, i think its might help my add a bit, but ive actually cut down to a cup a day.  I was obviously getting a bit burnt out from that much caffiene and also having trouble sleepingI'm in the UK! It could be possible, we have an anytime fitness down the road, I'm just worried about doing too much before workI just recovered from the worst DOMS I've ever had. Tuesday was leg day, and as my gym doesnt have a squat rack, I have to work with the machines. Everything went great, the last exersize I did was hamstring curls.

Fast forward to the next day, a little DOMS but not too much. mostly in my hamstrings.

Fast forward again to the day after that, I woke up.  
I could not get out of bed. My right hamstring had the worst DOMS I've ever felt. the left was pretty bad, but not even close to my right. As I could only move my leg a little bit, I had to warm it up somehow so I could get out of bed. The entire day was me walking like I broke my leg.

But the day after that it was fine.That photo made me physically uncomfortable. &gt;How should I mix these up or add other foods to reach 150gr...

Doesn't matter. If needed, just eat more of each. 

&gt;...does it matter if I get my proteins from vegetables or should they be meat?

http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2y5sso/any_differences_in_types_of_proteins_or_is_a/Ya I agree. But my point is there are so many other options as well. If 2 people mention chicken why keep posting chicken. Just add something new and more options. I do that but my gym doesn't have long ropes. It's really improved my face pulls and definitely my tricep pulldowns-- I can fully shorten my triceps and it kills them.You're fine. I don't know what this big scare of seeing results "too fast" is all about. It's as though people have this idea that the ONLY way to see real success is to see it slowly. I think that's absolute horseshit. 

The best answer that anyone who's not your doctor could give you is this: Do you feel okay? Do you get enough protein? Do you get enough vitamins and minerals in your diet? 

If the answer to all those questions is yes then you could lose 50 pounds in a month and still be okay. Losing a bunch of fat is never a bad thing man. Using the Smith bar for pushups is pretty standard prescription from trainers for noob clients.  However, the concept of "working in" is completely foreign.Not America but Americans as a general whole always recommend chicken. There is such variety out there. I guess maybe it's a reddit thing actually. It's like one stuck position. Sixty-four year old here. My main goals are cardiovascular fitness, protection of joints, muscle &amp; bone mass maintenance and flexibility in that order. To achieve this, I've been working out since my forties when I gave up clinical nursing which involved 8-12 hr days on my feet, moving patients and running to perform CPR, etc.

Five days a week I run 30 minutes on an elliptical which I regard as better than a treadmill or street-running as your muscles are working while your ankle, knee and hip joints are supported. As I age I will change to a stationary bike to offer more support and then, as decrepitude inevitably continues, start swimming and water aerobics. 

Another 30 minutes is spent in stretching &amp; moderate weight-lifting - six different muscle group sets of 3x15 exercises where the weight is just on the outer edge of comfortable. I'm not going to be all "muscly" but, I feel solid to the touch and have decent definition. Use machines rather than free weights as they guide correct repetitions. It also makes a spotter unnecessary. 

We are built to use our bodies but I fail to see the necessity of gaining massive bulk. If that floats your boat, all well and good but, I wonder how most 30-yr olds with huge muscle mass will fare as they age. i have had no major injuries beyond persistent, mild sore muscles which feel better after 800mg of Ibuprophen and the weekend away from working out. 

I've built my fitness slowly and persistently, not competing with anyone but myself. Regular, gentle exercise with a very gradual increase in speed, weight and resistance have been the keys. Also, recognizing that doing less weight than you're maximally capable of lifting will maintain joint &amp; muscle integrity longer. Boredom is probably your worst enemy after you have willed yourself to exercise habituation so, find some form of distraction. I avoid it by listening to EDM on headphones. The beat keeps a fast rhythm and the music is distracting enough to make the time go quickly. Check out FAQ regarding weight loss, diets. Learning all 4 of the standard strokes can help with balancing front and back. But honestly, you might still develop imbalanced muscles that still predispose you towards injuries.

Also, I suggest you head down to /r/swimming and ask them for their opinions. Especially about **[shoulder external rotations](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Infraspinatus/DBLyingExternalRotation.html)** and **swimmers' shoulder** and how to avoid the latter.The best advice I can give you is two fold. Never ever use the Smith machine for anything. The second part is never join a gym the lacks a squat rack.well i'm mainly looking for a way to do deadlifts thereToday you introduced me to not one, but TWO new favorite terms. Can't you use one though? [Something like this, but lying down?](http://www.theaestheticnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/top-5-dumbbell-tricep-exercises-seated-triceps-extensions.jpg) Sure it is. Count you calories.  Calories in calories outHe just looked like one of those fat old guys (had some muscle mass though) that knew it all 'back in the day'. I think at the point he's going to pull the respect card and ehh I didn't have too much problem with just doing as he said as long as it was a tricep excercise (just an accessory)Way to low Pull Ratio to Push, i just summed everything up in a Calculator you have 108 reps of Pushing (at the lower end without including dips they use alot shoulders too) to 99 reps on Pull. It is advised to use a 1:2 push pull ratio. I counted with you doing 30 pull ups 3 x 10 , if you do less what could happen if you are fatigue from the rows. Then it is even worse. I would take out the dips and take out the lateral raises or reduce the reps/sets on Ohp. 2 Triceps movement are enough. It's to much volume for your triceps, you won't really good recover from that. You are pressing this whole workout your triceps is involved all the time.

TLDR ; reduce Pushing volume to Pulling, and take out 1 Triceps movement. And in my opinion leg volume is to small compared to your overall volume on your upper body, throw in one quad exercise with 2 set and do 4 x 12 curls  harmstrings .Lets compare a short and a tall person gaining mass. Lets say they both gain weight at a rate of 1lb/week just for an example.  That means after a month of training they both gained 4 lbs with the same amount of effort. that 4 lbs on a tall person doesnt make as big of a visual difference on them because you are spreading that 4 lbs over a larger frame. Hey man, I'm really sorry to hear that. But those comments they made day way more about what kind of people they are than what kind of lifter you are. [Want to roleplay?](http://i.imgur.com/sXAkbdU.jpg)I don't understand. Were they using it as some sort of weird, horribly dangerous, chest press device? I am a broke grad student and I do not just eat chicken every day. Tuna us cheap,  eggs are cheap.  Pork roasts are cheap for amount of meat you get. I mean... Wtf. jokes.  they happen sometime.Recover from surgery.  Then squats  lunges,  and bulking I think.  That's my best advice XDIt's all so clear now. Thanks for the diagram!Heres a good fly over of metabolic damage: http://www.jissn.com/content/11/1/7

Frankly it's highly unlikely to be you. You're not special. You need to diet. Stop being a hypothetical arm chair commander.no?No.Well with that math you can hit your protein needs with less than a pound of chicken. Honestly unless you are on a cut getting enough protein without shakes is pretty easy. That's really harsh. I remember one of my lecturers mentioning that every guy should be able to bench at least 45kgs. I was not able to bench 45kgs at that point so I was really butthurt as well and it made me feel really weak.

There's really nothing else to do but keep on going back.This drives me completely bonkers.we ain't always preaching butt plugs for nothin. Use that shit.In fittit how much you lift almost always means stats for deadlift, squat, and bench press. Not sure why.

To improve your strength, I'd include sets of 5RM lifts to your routine. General consensus is 5RM for strength, 10-12RM for aesthetics, 15+ for endurance. Yes just ask for a spotter, preferably someone resting/just finished their set. I have never been refused a spot so far. When I do skull crushers, I will lie down on the bench and use a bar, palms facing the ceiling, and the bar is just above my forehead.Story time fellow redditors!

&gt;Working out with gymbro

&gt;Chest/Triceps day, making all kinds of gains

&gt;Suddenly, THAT guy walks in

&gt;Longpants, Hoodie, Earbuds

&gt;EARBUDS in a gym that already plays music

&gt;Doesnt even change, "gymwear" already on

&gt;Walks straight to the squatrack

&gt;Starts squatting with just the bar (wat)

&gt;Loads a few small plates on

&gt;Does 5 struggling reps 

&gt;Sits down, face already red as a tomato

&gt;Sits on his fucking ass for over 2 mins before doing 5 more

&gt;Considers his "set" done, deloads the bar

&gt;Uses the SAME FUCKING BAR to do OHP

&gt;Without clips

&gt;PT at the gym runs over and shows him where the clips are

&gt;Mumbles something about not needing them and reluctantly puts them on

&gt;Gymbro mouths "what the fuck" and just stares

&gt;Mr earbud does the same 5 forced reps

&gt;Panting from less reps than I do as warmup, he deloads the bar again

&gt;Drops it to the floor

&gt;Starts doing deadlifts with THE SAME FUCKING BAR

&gt;Entiregymstaring.jpg

&gt;Hoodieboy does 5 painfully struggling reps and then just gives up

&gt;Deloads the bar

&gt;Walks straight out of the gym

&gt;Doesnt even SHOWER OR CHANGE CLOTHES

&gt;Me and friend are practically in tears

&gt;Mfw his "workout" took less time than our tricepsets

&gt;Mfw this fucktard returns two days later IN THE SAME CLOTHES

Saw him getting weighed at the gym once, he even gained weight lmaoAlright don't listen to these fools that say no.  They'll most likely be stuck under 500lb their entire life.  Yes you should incorporate them into your routine.  You should also use sumo if you lift conventional and vise versa.  Adding the other two will improve your preferred deadlift.  If you use the trap bar then first flip it upside down (already stated once here).  If your gym has enough 35lb plates then use them so you will get an added couple inches of depth.  Use deficit deadlifts, rack pulls and pause deadlifts if you are serious about pulling heavy weight.http://imgur.com/yT8MJtw

Me. 6'8".72+ hours working? You definitely need help. For sure. There's not really any "correct" way of doing skull crushers when it comes to the kind of weights you use, just do what feels natural. Personally I like to use a bar.A spoon of peanut putter has 1.4 gr protein

wutYou could, but would you want to?  That's not a lot of protein anyway? You'd be surprised how easily protein can add up throughout the day. There's vegetarian bodybuilders so it definitely doesn't have to just come from meat. Protein is protein.

I eat about 150g/day so I'll just give you a rundown of what I do:


Breakfast: 2 eggs + 1/2c egg whites in a taco, with a little shredded cheese
Snack: Almonds or jerky (you could do pb on bread here)
Lunch: ~200g chicken, or a can of tuna, in either a taco or on a salad
Snack: same as before, possibly 2 boiled eggs if I'm home from work
Dinner: Beef/chicken/fish, lots of Brussels sprouts or broccoli, brown rice, salad on the side, and 2 cups of milk. 

I basically make up for shortages during the rest of the day with whatever I have for dinner. Smith is great for pushups, variable height = variable difficulty.  I like to use it for hanging rows as well. Honestly when I first started at the gym I had no idea it was for lifting weights. I thought the Smith machine was just a variable height bar. Injured my IT Band so have to skip running this weekend. Loved every second of having the gym to myself this morning. Dropkick Murphy's in my ears and Italians looking dumbfounded at TRX exercises. 
Finished with a good 15 minutes of Sauna and Freezing pool. I'm feeling ready to celebrate my birthday tonight! Go track down Bret Contreras  (the glute guy). This is his niche and he has a bunch of relevant posts on his blog.i saw a guy who is pretty big and with very little body fat deadlift in the smith machine this week.  huh?  he does look like he skips leg day, his calves are toothpicks, but i'm not at the gym every day so maybe he does legs when i'm not there.  every time i see someone use the smith machine, all i can think of is Dom's voice in my head say "you're lifting on the moon!".  But seeing someone deadlift in the smith machine was something i've never ever seen before, and by someone who has spent A LOT of time at the gym with resultsBobo drink a lot of water. Bobo sure?Right?! The smith machines with the perpendicular angles are the worse. I question the man who thinks shifting the weight behind or in front of a persons midline is functional.  

Squatting with a barbell of allows you you maintain the weight over your midline (center of the foot) which prevents poor hip or knee displacement. Leading to knee pain from undue pressure on the patella, or sore hips from improper positioning. 

Smith Machine Bad. Squat Rack Good.&gt; Pretty much no one at 60 is "injury free"

Well we can agree that there's a difference between having aches and pains and having a herniated disk, replaced knee or hip etc. That's latter is what I meant by injury free.

~~If anything, the goal would be to find activity done long term that will prevent normal issues that come with aging. For example, a lot of seniors have severe hip issues because they lose muscle tone, bone density and balance with age.~~ user below already covered this :)

These are issues that an ideal fitness regime can go a long way towards alleviating. Or so I hope in my own case. I see so many people with deadlifts as pull exercises and obviously different strokes and all but it always makes me cringe!I want to befriend a shredded bro so he can help me lose this weight and gain muscle. They always seem very nice.In between squat sets, stand straight and straight up and practice clenching your glutes by screwing your feet into the ground. Hold that for at least 15 seconds.  It'll help you build a better awareness of your butt and help you use it when you squat.Shoulda boy tell 'em!Squat the shit out!I always called it a Gazelle but I didn't know if it had a real nameI work out at my local YMCA and I've frequently gotten there and there is equipment everywhere - Dumbbells, Swiss balls, boxes, etc.  I get there one day while a trainer (employed by the Y) is wrapping up a session and he has equipment scattered for his trainee's circuits. Session over and the trainer walks away... Without putting anything back or having his trainee put anything back!! You're a trainer for crying out loud, you should know better!!!!Isn't the running joke from Rant Wednesdays about throwing a dumb bell at someone? Or was it a plate. Either was it's still hystericalstarted doing dead lifts for the first time about two weeks ago. I asked a guy who usually knock some out like do the things you do for me some assistance. He looked at me like I was an idiot and I had just insulted his mother. then as I'm struggling to get the technique right. one of the biggest guys in the gym walks over and asks how long I've been doing deadlifts. I say this is my secound time trying. He says with a smile "it shows". then precedes to show me the proper technique. he said he would hate if he saw someone hurt themselves knowing he could have done something to prevent it. I ended up doing a set of 315 for 6 reps. never knew what it was like my lower back to be so soreLotsa squats"compliment" - "the compliment he received from the big tank guy was nice complement to the others the OP received for not calling out the 1/4 squat guy."  Today was biceps day for me. I have been going to the gym for only a week. I am a skinny guy wanting to build strength and body.

The guy who was helping me with the gym put a 10kg dumbbell in my hand and told me to do Dumbbell curl. The thing is I wasn't even able to lift it properly with my left hand the first time. I had to move my arm a bit wide and then lift the dumbbell to do the curl. I am worried that this is bad form. I did EZ-bar curl, barbell curl, and dumbbell hammer similarly after that since I wasn't able to lift the equipment using proper form.

Can someone please give me a bit of perspective? Thanks.Woops, sorry guys for not creating the post as usual. Been driving for a while and couldn't find a chance to do it.the ones laughing are sad. 

I know of many powerlifters that *don't* look big and strong and always do a few warmup sets with the bar only before working up to their workout weight. Imagine how theses women would have felt if you had added some weight and got back under the bar, did another set, then added more weight, etc. until you were benching more than your body weight?

I have seen this happen with both overweight guys and skinny guys - but without the laughing. I agree with madchowcha, just keep making progress and before you know it, they won't be laughing.you think that's bad? I have lived on 70% rice and eggs 5 days of the week since like septemberYou might not be eating enough to keep building strength if you have been deloading. Figure out your tdee and make sure to be eating over on lift days off you want to keep building strength and muscle.

Good form for powerlifting is the whatever moves the most weight within the standard of your fed.

Fitness is task specific. It like how the word need always has a suppressed clause.  No one needs to breath. We all need to breath so we can live. Sunday morning chest day, greatest thing ever. The older crowd is at church, and the younger crowd is sleeping in. If you haven't already, I'd also include deadlifts to your routine as well. Deadlift is arguably the best lift for building your overall strength and it focuses on lower back. Mix with milk and throw in some ice cream of your choice Tara stiles bedtime yoga [Maybe something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz8y3R0SKbs)Very heavy negatives and overloaded partials.  Get in a power rack, add an extra plate or so.&gt; Good martial arts programs are always focused on long-term health, rather than short-term gains.

Interesting. Thanks for the info. I'm personally inclined more towards BW fitness, yoga and some low-impact cardio.

I've always imagined martial arts as somethign you need to do starting at a young age (like music) Because I don't want to literally flush my gains down the toilet? Some people experience more of that effect on their digestive system than others. It's not exactly inconceivable that if drinking coffee makes you poo more then your body hasn't finished digesting it and you don't absorb the protein.If it's any consolation, people frequently throw trash out their car window and yell shit at me when I'm out riding my bike.

I will not let the gainz goblins win. I will not let the gainz goblins win.

Don't let the gainz goblins win.
Eat enough protein.

Avoid overeating until you adhust to your calorie requirements--otherwise if you have a reduce activity level you'll get fat.

Do physio. Return to resistance training when you're cleared by your surgeon.

You'll gain muscle and strength back within 3 months. Based on personal experience on three different 3 to 8 month recoveries after injures or very extreme weight loss.Find a new gym. You're wasting time That's either really good dedication or you're on a student budget! haha Oh yes, I have a dropped a barbell on my face before. Quite embarrassing, and then I had a lovely bruise for a few weeks.It's a council ran gym where I have access to multiple gyms in the district I get access to classes and all the swimming pools as well. 

The other gyms a bit further out are better equiped, it just so happens that the closest most convenient one for me lacks the rack.  Looks like I'll do a bit extra travel. It can happen like that.  Stay positive and don't let what they say bring you down.  You have your own goals to achieve, don't let the opinions of others affect that.

Also, perhaps consider mentioning it to the gym.  Employees should be supportive and promoting business, what she did is contrary to this.I workout at a rather small gym and am proud to say I'm one of the larger people who workout there. For the past couple weeks I've hit a real plateau with my bench so I've started using and underhand grip on the bar rather than the typical overhand. I had a couple people look at me like I was insane but I'm big enough so no one says anything to me. I just hate the fact people judge you because of the exercise you're doing. No stair stepper is vertical I would say the opposite when it comes to stride length. Taking shorter strides allows for a more fluid running style to take place. Taking long strides usually results in a very high impact stride which can cause injuries. Especially downhill and uphill shorter strides are preferred.

When it comes to moving your arms you should especially move your arms far back. You should feel a slight stretch in your pec muscle, especially running downhill. This causes you to stay upright and not "fall forward" in your stride.

Last but not least running style is very individual, and the short-stride step is something I've been taught by a very experienced triathlete. I'm not an expert either but this is what works for me.Squats with good formI'm curious what people think of PPL for someone going for fat loss that's maybe more on the beginner side as far as weight numbers go. I find SL workouts very boring, and I prefer to lift more than 3x week.With you totally- at least that's my personal inclination at this point. I would add low-impact cardio to the mix, but fitness wise that's my ideal combination.

It has little to nothing to do with your limb length.  Erase that excuse from your mind.

Bench more frequently and increase the volume.  Dial in your technique. I guarantee it can use work.Like stealing gainz from a babyI used to go to my old gym in the morning.  It was in a nicer part of town where most of the guys in the morning were either successful business types or really, really old guys.  Typically I would lift, hit the steam room and head home to shower since I only lived about a mile away.  However, since the only way to the steam room was through the locker room, and because you couldn't go in there with shoes on, I had to store my shoes in the bathroom/locker room on the way.  Maybe I'm just sensitive, but there were several cases of what I would call poor locker room etiquette which I will now list for consideration:

1.  standing at the urinals in bare feet while taking a piss. (every day)
2.  old men drying their nutsacks by hanging their wrinkly balls under the hand dryer (at least weekly, more than 1 different person)
3.  multiple guys standing ass-naked in front of the mirrors, shaving at the same time and exchanging small talk.
4.  lots of naked eye contact and conversation from across the locker room area, all while taking just a litttttle too long to get dressed.  
5.  guys walking to the shower with their towels slung over their shoulders, dongs hanging out, rather than just wrapping the towels around their waists.

Maybe I'm alone, but I feel like unnecessary nakedness is real.  That's exactly itYour submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

Mine felt like it grew overnight once I started doing squats. Warning: you'll get unsolicited female attention though!Agree 100% on diet being no.1 to prevent cardiovascular disease, obesity.I was working about the same amount of hours last year and I made it to the gym 3 times a week regularly. Maybe you don't need to go 7 times a week. What are you doing that requires you to go everyday? Besides that, what kept me going was I love to lift and lots of caffeine. Yeah. They were standing on the seat on pushing the press part. We all had to stop and watch because it was so counterintuitive. Learn to just eat pounds of meat. I've been eating between 1 and 1.5 lbs most days and that brings me up to around 140g (if 1lb is lean chicken breast), plus a couple eggs, some cheese, a disgusting amount of vegetables, and occasionally some protein powder add ~20g, 5-10g, ~10-20g, and 10-40g respectively.Some older guy at my gym has decided I'm his gym buddy.  He comes over to me pretty often, starts conversions, asks me things.  A week or two ago he invited me out for "dinner or coffee sometime."  I get the sense this guy may be lonely, not gay (and let me stress that being gay is fine), and I feel bad for him.  I want to be kind, but I don't want to encourage him, and when I'm at the gym I just want to be left alone.  Frustrating.

Also four people have ditched me in the past two weeks.  I need to move away from this fucking town and start a new life somewhere else.

But I'm teaching myself Python, so I've got that going for me.I was at the gym yesterday, and I saw a couple holding hands while walking around the gym... Not sure if they were supposed to go somewhere else... And not the gym... but they were also making out when one was "resting" in between sets.


The shit you see. I generally have 3 large meals a day, 2 lunches and a dinner, breakfast is usually rushed and I don't really like large meals when I wake up so I stick to cereal, usually weet-bix or cheerios.

I get the bulk of my protein mainly from chicken or beef. Snacks in between can be a nut bar, peanut butter sandwich or some eggs. Large meals are usually a few hours between each other, snacks somewhere between those when you start to get peckish.

I don't really measure anything so I just fill half a container(500ml?) with meat, then the other half evenly between vegetables and rice. Milk is also a big contributor which I get from my breakfast / at night before bed.

If you are wanting to bulk without supplements (which I personally prefer) all you need to do is have more regular substantial meals. As for the source, protein is protein, all depends where you prefer to get it.Ahh, I see why you'd wanna be careful with leg work. What you're doing in the shower is very similar to a swiss ball wall squat. Personally, I would not be worried if you don't feel like wall squats bother you, though I think you can and should eventually squat normally.

I think given that you might consider spending some time working on your cardio fitness.  As to your questions here are my best answers:

-- Fatigue will limit ANY training, including strength training. 

-- Increasing your bodies cardiovascular health and endurance will help your other training so long as you appropriately compensate for the additional calorie burn by eating more food.    Its a misinformation that cardio will drain your body of your new muscles.  Cardio will burn additional calories and if you don't add them back into your diet, you can run a caloric deficit and this can limit your muscular development. 

-- Any type of cardio or HIIT that you enjoy will be best.  Do it twice a week to start.  My personal bias is towards treadmill HIIT with 60 second intervals at high speed followed by 2 minutes of rest at a fast walk.  How long you go depends on your current physical ability but generally 15 to 30 minutes is recommended. 
Hehe. I did his P90 series and only found out later he's like 55 or something - mind was blown.You aren't going to hurt anything. You just won't build a lot of muscle. I'd worry about skipping though. 

Also Scooby Skateboard Squats...is planet fitness your gym?Maybe she was doing some kind of shitty power jerk? Pretty please.Dude, just keep at it. I remember when I first started going to the gym and I was always worried about what others thought or said about me. You really get to a point where you realize that you're there for one reason, to better yourself. If there are people there who judge or ridicule you for the amount of weight you put up. Fuck em. Those aren't the kind of people you want to associate with or to be a part of your life. Don't let a couple of people's negative comments discourage you. Keep at it and just keep heading towards your goals! Man I feel for ya if your grocery store only has chicken and nothing else. Chicken and fish are very protein heavy. You can bulk by just eating fish and chicken for your protein needsOlive oil and icing sugar. On everything.

That pizza? Needs extra cheese, extra olive oil, and maybe some nutella.I've been a swimmer my entire life. I've competed at a relatively high level and upon becoming a triathlete, I was  consistently the first one out of the water. Now let me tell you, if I had gone out and swam laps for an hour without swimming consistently beforehand, I would be supremely sore. Let me explain. 

The best swimmers are very  efficient. Each stroke transfers the greatest amount of power to the water while the body maintains the most streamlined possible position. Highly efficient swimmers can cross the pool in surprisingly few strokes. On the other hand, people who can swim, but aren't necessarily excellent swimmers are much less efficient. They may take many more strokes to cross pool because their hands are cavitating (capturing air bubbles as they enter the water) and because they're shortening their stroke, not taking advantage of their full reach. 

The result of this can be that the limiting factor in the less efficient swimmer's workout will be cardiovascular. They can swim their ass off and while their heart may be pumping and they're breathing hard, their arms won't get tired or sore because their form prevents them from exerting their maximum potential force on the water. 

Unless I'm mistaken and you are a very efficient swimmer already, I would recommend checking out some videos on swimming form on YouTube. Trust me, once you get your stroke nailed and you start taking long, powerful, efficient strokes, you will definitely start to feel the burn in your shoulders and lats. 

I'm also curious about how your hour worth of laps is structured. When I hear "swam laps for an hour" I think swam for an hour straight. No stopping on the wall. Swimming for an hour straight is a hell of a workout regardless of your form. I do that as part of base training or when I'm swimming in open water but it's not even that common for me (nor was it very common in conventional swim training). If what you're talking about is swimming for an hour with frequent stops on the wall, that makes a bit more sense. In that case I would say, try lengthening the duration of your swims as you get more efficient and lengthen out those strokes. Also, don't be afraid to swim (or at least with a lower tempo) . Really grabbing the water and taking nice long powerful strokes will give you a much better workout that rapidly thrashing through the pool. 

One you get to the point where you can swim for long periods at a time without getting fatigued cardiovascularly, you can start introducing speed work. I'm talking about interval training...  10 x 100's on 1:30 or 2:00, 5 x 200's on 3:00 etc. These will definitely test your cardio if you're pushing hard but make sure you don't sacrifice your stroke. Stay long and smooth, just increase your tempo. 

If you get to this point and you really are looking for some consistent workouts, Google "swimming interval workouts" and you will find millions of them. Even better, join a masters swim team and you'll have a coach who can create workouts just for you and where you're at. 

In general, swimming is a killer workout, unequalled by any other activity in many regards. 

Hope this was helpful.

It's pretty hard to gauge. I'd say to start with a depth that you can do comfortably and pain free for 3 sets of 10 reps or something like that. Takes careful experimentation and trying to feel how the the lower back and core are doing.The ol' turtle headExcellent points!

Wondering though how no.3 will play out in our generations' future.Smith machines are for assistance lifts. So don't do your heavy work on them, ask to work in on the squat rack and keep using the bench press.

I use the smith machine for shrugs and single leg squats. I've seen people use them for glute bridges(I think that's what it's called), and as a leg press of sorts.You could make one up, involving a wayward bee or wasp that got trapped in your butt cheeks during naked squats.

Give it a Rube Goldberg plot, take your time, make it good. ;D

( I workout at a home too, it's perfectly effective and uneventful )

This is literally why I switched gyms. Not a gym story, but a few weeks ago someone posted something about removing back hair. That in turn lead me on to the Mangroomer. Thank you, shirts just feel so much smoother now.Chicken breast is not going to have enough calories when you take into account the increased resting energy expenditure of increased protein intake, and the amount of time it will take to overcome the satiated feeling.

Carbs and fats with moderate protein.

Pasta, pancakes, donuts, pizza with the bad toppings, high fat content meats, Starbucks, extra butter nutella muffins.You seem too heavy to be at this "ottermode".  

Solution: Do cardio everyday. You really don't even need to do that much. 10 minutes of intense rowing/cycling per day should do (given that you keep your macros in check). 

Next: abs. After every cardio session, do an ab routine. Mine is as follows: 20 3/4-situps, 20 coons, 20 of a few other ab exercises for which I can't produce a name. 

Point is, burn fat and do some weight training so that you maintain strength and aesthetic muscle mass, especially in your arms. 

Diet: Cut carbs down to below 80g per day during the week and do a re-feed on saturdays. keep protein to between 140-190 grams. Eat your veggies. 

Don't do that shit you linked. It's a bunch of crap and you'll not only look like an idiot in the gym, you'll also hurt yourself. 

Source: Was in "ottermode" for a long time.This "gym" has no barbells and no squat rack.A couple weeks ago, I was in the gym and it was about half an hour before they closed. Some other dude and I were the only ones using the free weight area. I can't remember what I was doing, but it didn't involve the squat rack. The other guy came up to me and asked me if I needed to use the squat rack. I said no. He then went and started curling in it. If you're going to curl in the squat rack, this is what you do; make sure no one else needs it.Ya I've had a sneaking suspicion that I just haven't been eating enough. My tdee is around 3100 calories ( I work out 3 days a week and have a physical job) My question is now that I have began tracking my food with MFP (based on my body type) Would I be better off cutting or bulking at the moment. When starting a cut and bulk cycle how do you determine which to start? I assume this is completely personal preference and dependent on your goals?Miso paste or blended frozen peas.yes! ive noticed most of the recommendations are leaning toward heavy lifting. 

im looking to basically do what you've done, take a course, self study and pass. i casnt afford to take the course i have in mind atm, so was hoping to get a text book with all the need to know info, revise, and get ahead. so your saying ACSM's textbooks cover that? thanks! this is what i need. ill look it up on amazon. im a brit btw This is something I wrote in another post:

I've had a pretty severe case of anterior pelvic tilt and I managed to fix it. This is how I did it:

Stretch the lower back: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0kMPOfxPos

stretch the hip flexors, quads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WMSkf-kg4

stretch the hamstrings link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrF2iMnn09w

The stretches alone probably won't be strong enough so what you'll have to do is massage these tight body parts with a hard ball before you stretch them. Massaging in itself will break down a lot of tension .

Sometimes massage will work, sometimes finding a trigger point (very sensitive, painful, tight spot) and just staying on it until the pain subsides will work.

A good tip for identifying trigger points is this: when you press on it the pain TRAVELS to another place on the body. It's like referral pain. Example: "pressing on the butt and the pain travels through the whole leg."

It's a sign of chronic tension, stubborn long lasting tension. Focus your attention on these parts.

Start with a tennis ball and when you can take it do it with a baseball or hockey ball (harder balls lol).

I promise that with these 3 exercises you won't have anterior pelvic tilt anymore and you'll feel great doing these exercises. I've done them all.

Kit laughlin's youtube channel is the best if you suffer from posture problems or just want to improve flexibility. I highly recommend it.

Send me a private message if you want to go further o just need advice on something. I'm working with my posture as we speak, my posture is pretty good now but I striving for fantastic haha.

PS: each stretch must be done for a minimum of 2 minutes for the tissues to change.

Good luck NofapnoGlory

Here here bros, this isn't a story about gym lifting but it is a story about lifting. 

I'm currently on vacation in Florida, a nice break from Chicago winter weather. My girl friend's grandmother is cooking us a delicious french toast breakfast when she gets a call that her neighbor, a 95 year old woman staying alone named Ethel, fell trying to get out of bed and calls, panicked and asking for help. The French toast comes off the stove and the three of us rush over to the golf cart (everyone here drives a golf cart). I take tail gunner seat and we drive  10 houses down to where Ethel lives. We open up the garage and find Ethel in her room. 

Ethel is on the floor by her bed, unable to help herself up. I am the only lifter out of the three of us and the only one strong enough to lift Ethel. She is shocked and shaky, so I crouch down and ask her to trust me. I then proceed to straddle her and assume a forklift-like position. The Valsalva maneuver is fired up and I'm ready to do this. I summon the strength of Brodin and lift her up to the bed, like a front shoulder raise and back extension in one. I set her gently on the edge of the bed and she cries tears of fear and appreciation. We help her make breakfast and comfort her some more, then we leave once again to enjoy our breakfast. 

Just something that happened a few minutes ago, interesting way to start the day. My GF was impressed and said I'd be laid if we weren't staying at her grandma's. I told her Ethel weighed 100 but she was actually like 80 ;)So, with the apple cider vinegar... did you just drink it straight out of the bottle or dilute it?

You remind me of [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/iczBLCa.png). All joking aside, nice progress.Because their literal job is to help people get into shape and you showed up with the expectation they were here to help people and they let you down hard bro.

That's so shitty.  No one laughs at me when I'm trying to do 30lbs on a machine and look like I'm going to die.  It started off at 15, now it's 30, soon it'll be 50. Keep going and remember this in the future when you're a strong ass dude and see a newcomer struggling.  Smile and make them feel welcome What are you feeling that makes you think your glutes aren't working in your squat? 

Are you externally rotating your femurs very hard? You must have quite a bit of hip flexion in a deep low bar squat, do you believe only your hamstrings are being used to extend the hip on the ascent? "We are not a gym."

--Planet FitnessYou may not have the biomechanics to use your glutes fully for squats. Try a wider stance to see if that helps. Otherwise, barbell hip thrusts and deadlifts are great.My girlfriend's dad and I were doing 2-handed bicep cable curls on one of those big cable units with like 8 or so cables. ( bad explanation, I'm sure if you've ever been in a gym you know what I'm talking about.).  We start with a quick warm-up, when a petite 40-or-so year old lady comes over to us, swings her leg way up and props it on the bar RIGHT beside the cable we're using..incase you don't know what I mean by the bar: there's a bar about 1/3 of the way up beside the cable you can use to stabilize yourself when doing 1-handed exercises. 
Now we're trying to do our cable curls, and we have this woman's foot INCHES away from the cable just staring at us.  We look around and there is EASILY 3 other places she can do this where nobody is currently working out. She does both legs, then turns around and stretches her quads too (she easily could have held her foot behind her back for this one...0 need for that bar.). 
TL:DR   Woman tried to seduce my girlfriends dad and I by stretching inches away from us, she's now known
to us as Gumbo  
Jeez. Any idea what they were fighting over?? I'm just curious as to what would compel someone to do that. Its up to you if you do too much. You can go in to the gym, do a light work out for 30 minutes, (if possible) take a shower at the gym and start your dayI do a ton of accessories, here is my routine.Do you think a bench Dropset at the end of my workout would help?

Huh, that one flew right over my head. I seriously had no idea anyone "seemed" angry. I was just trying to explain it in case someone misunderstood.Thats horrible, that chick that works there should be ashamed, and you should report her to management. 

Don't let the haters drag you down manA guy used the flat bench press for a set and then texted for, I shit you not, a good 7-8 minutes. So I ask him if he's actually going to use it and he answers "Yah", does one more set and goes to do an other exercise. A little while later, I'm doing cable flies and as I'm about to start a set, he asks me if I'm going to use them any longer, "Yeah we can use them alternately." Him: "Sure". So I go on and do my set but towards the end I start feeling a rumble in my stomach, now, I think back to the fact that he interfered with my gains and decide to leave my grotesque I-didnt-take-a-shit-this-morning scent for him to enjoy.

TD;LR Guy takes forever between sets on bench press, asks if he can use cables after me, leave a disgusting fart before he uses them.what in the fuck....I probably wouldn't suggest glutamine foe performance outcomes. I havent been able to observe any carry over into training. 

I am trying glutamine again to see how it affects poop quality and other qualitative feelings of poop happiness--smell, shade, shape, texture.

Protein and creatine. Pre workout if you're into that. Greens+ or similar.Seek a therapist. It can work wonders if you are experiencing panic attacks. They will be able to walk you through exposure techniques and help overcome any anxiety you may have.
Or you can research exposure techniques and apply them yourself if you are confident enough.There's this guy who comes in, finds the one person doing cardio and takes the machine directly next to them.  He leaves after about 10-15 minutes.  Not only that, but he uses the elliptical like a scooter, keeping one leg stiff and pedaling with the other.  When he happens to use the treadmill, he tip-toes the entire time, like with his calves raised.  Not only that, but he doesn't listen to music or watch the TVs, but tries to make conversation with the person he sought out. Drives me up a wall.Second the recovery from surgery part. But also suggesting hip thrusts, I hear they're huge ass makers. I already have a too huge ass so I don't do them myself.?(?o ?)Piggyback question:

I can bench more weight when using the poor form shown in the top picture in OP's post than when I use the good form in the bottom picture. Would this just be because my shoulders and chest got stronger than my chest and lats from benching wrong for so long? Would the best idea be to deload to a weight where I can do my routine with the correct form and work my way back up?Had the same problem, it was a mobility issue. Stretch everyday. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=J-6W2B7vS28. That one did the job for me. Also if youre beginning to squat, dont go heavy too fast. Let the body adapt. Took 3 to 4 months for me.I've yet to witness the gyms greatest sin, squat rack curling. I did however encounter something that made may jaw hit the floor faster than a 1 rep max deadlift. The rack was occupied by someone using the bar to lean against at waist height to do incline push ups. It wasn't a small dude either, and then he went on to superset it with pullups in the rack next to it as the first didn't have pull up hantles. 
Tl;dr incline squat rack pushupsYou don't need to be heavy to have a strenous bodyweight workout. Single leg squats and handstand pushups are quite challenging even if you have normal weight for instance.Thanks!

Maybe yoga mat for slip prevention and for doing planks on. Then look at the FAQ, specifically the two dumbbell programs. I personally recommend doing goblet squats and no lunges, split squats or single leg work until you're a bit stronger/more stable.

You can also ask /r/homegymThat feel when a stranger walks across a room full of lifters to ask you for a spot....Look at my post I answered another guy. This will definitely fix your problem. I know from my own experience. 

I don't know why you find so many advice on the internet about strenghening or activating muscles. It really doesn't work at all.

You almost have to brainwash yourself to see results. 

What I've discovered is that in a weird way stretching makes your muscles stronger and more activated. It's a bit counterintuitive but again from own experience it's true. 

When you have anterior pelvic tilt you have a hard time squeezing your butt. You have a weak butt. I've tried doing butt exercises it did not work.

When I stretched it became more reactive and stronger. My butt was in constant tension and by relieving taht tension it began to function optimally. 

Hope that helpsDefinitely bulk. You look pretty lean, and if you clean bulk you'll probably still be lean by summer.Well, looks like your deadlifting dumb bells today. By the time youre done cleaning all that shit up, you'll be looking like Arnold.Anything can used as a bicep curl machineEdgyThanks! Yeah, I will keep the ellbows in mind :)

As amlaminack says, I'm stretching my hip flexors and doing hip thrusts.
Besides that, lifting in general helped by improving my general fitness - I had almost no physical activity before that ;)

But I think no training and stretching just fixes APT (or other posture problems) magically.
What is pretty important for me is actively trying to improve my posture when standing and walking. This takes a conscious effort at the beginning but will happen automatically after some time :)I hope you're trolling and didn't actually shit yourself.

I'm in between sets so just kinda jamming, and checking everything out. In walks second guy (mid 50s), wearing a Kosama shirt, kinda built but not really, we'll call him Kosamabag. Second guy walks in between the squat rack older dude is at and totally bumps the bar mid squat. Older man does the smart thing and just drops it on the bail outs. While Kosamabag says a quick sorry and continues on walking. I watched the whole thing happen and couldn't believe it. After helping older dude re rack his bar, we both had a wtf shrug and continued on. LOLI drove in blizzard like conditions to the gym only to find out it was closed...

I hear stretching helps so i'm definitely going to start doing that. Thanks! PlayoffsThanks so much for your input and congratulations btw in choosing a healthy lifestyle!

I say that because my own parents who are in your age group, made the choice despite my urging over the years, to not exercise their bodies. It doesn't seem to get register with them that's it's not just a lifespan issue, but a quality of life thing.

For boredom - do you think in retrospect it would have been better to try varied things (with a slightly higher injury risk) or just stick with what you know and tough it out?If you've been cutting hard for 6+ months, there's a good chance. If you've just started, don't worry about it.If you're benching less than 60% of your bodyweight push-ups are the correct answer. Otherwise the learning curve for bench press technique isn't worth the time investment for a regular joe.Cut out the quest bar, sweet potato fries.  Try intermittent fasting for improved fat burning.

&gt; One gram of protein per pound of body weight (1 g/lb) or 2.2 grams per kilogram (2.2 g/kg) is the traditional recommendation for protein intake. However, this can be considered the upper bound of target intake, with [the suggested range](http://examine.com/faq/how-much-protein-do-i-need-every-day.html) being **0.68-1g/lb** (1.5-2.2g/kg) of total body weight.I like to use Smith Machines for what I call "bottom tier accessory work".  Bottom tier doesn't mean worst, it means lowest difficulty (to me). 

Example, I use the smith machine for my compound pressing (overhead and forward pressing).  After a few primary compounds with dumbbells or barbells, I like to use the smith machine for continued work load, but in a way that makes it less stressful.

So, as example, last night looked liek this:

* Standard Grip Barbell Speed Bench 8 x 3 
* Very Close Grip Bench Press 3 x 10
* Lat Pulls with Bands
* Smith Machine Shallow Incline Press 3 x 12
* Lying Triceps Extensions 3 x 10+

By the time I got to my 3rd pressing movement, I wanted to work the muscles but felt gassed from earlier work and didn't want to stress stabilization work too much.  Taking a wide grip witht he smith machine let me put in work on my chest, triceps,a nd shoulders without taxing my ability to stabilize the weight after already going through some pretty good work earlier.As a father of three I can confirm that human milk is super fucking sticky.On Thursday someone had signed into my gym under the name Richard Glute. Laughed pretty hard when I realized.Shit, I misread the post. I guess you don't have much of a choice. I'm sure there are lots of people who have gotten good workouts using the smith machine. I've used it for basic lifts when I've been to a gym that doesn't have a proper rack. If you're not training to be a power lifter you'll do just fine with the smith machine. But don't give up the dumbbell press, especially the incline DB press - that lift is gold. Can i ask, how far will dumbbells get me. i'm really damn skinny and not very strong, so is it better to stick with dumbbels in the start till i gain some muscle, or should i look at benching straight away?Mercifully, the weights I was working on were mostly what they left lying around, so I would just grab a pair and then put them back when I finished my set. By the end of it, either me or other dudes there had mostly cleared the area. *certain athletes. 

Whereas lunges and bilateral movements have more crossover.That sucks. The fact that one was an employee is even shitier (go to mananagement), but there is good news. In a few months you'll be struggling with at least twice that weight, and eventually even more (struggling is a good sign; it means you're working hard). 

Report the trainer?Damn, amazing progress. What routine have you been following?I work out at my high school gym and had a really tough leg day, my legs were shaking and walking was a struggle. So one of my friends gave me a piggy back ride to my locker. It was hypeWisdom only comes from experience.Unfortunately the best hting to do is find a new gym or outfit your own if you're serious about barbell training.BrahldarTry some foam rolling. After that, you can train the muscles you *don't* use much at work (if any). You're gonna want to maintain structural balance between your muscle groups.I understand and agree with that. But my confusion is over the fact that I am unable to lift even an empty barbell using proper form. How do I reduce the weight then?The circle jerk of "i dont understand how to do critical reasoning and risk assessment, but SS/SL blsrgo" hit you hard, but it's true.Guy at my gym was taking 10 minute breaks between doing sets of deadlifts with like 300 lbs on the bar. Guy couldn't even lift it to his knees. Would put it down, rest 10 minutes, get a drink of water, chalk his hands and go at it again.I don't understand the issue with him not changing? I walk down to my gym in my workout gear and walk home in it to have a shower back here every day as, I'm sure, many people do.Left foot strikes breath IN

... and repeat

very important: on your LEFT foot.My thoughts exactlyLean beef, tuna, beans, Greek yogurt + almonds, peanut butter. Why?  I try to give humanity the benefit of the doubt, but this is such a simple lesson, "clean up after you're done."  You learn it when you're 4.  I go to a big corporate gym and NO ONE unracks weights. 

But then I go to my small town gym and everyone racks weights and wipes stuff down.  It's like each behavior is contagious?Looks good, but the biggest problem with PPL is that you are doing twice as much upper body than lower body workouts. Okay so I may be able to help as a complete newbie here but someone maybe 5 weeks farther on from you. I was/am that couch potato (190cm tall, 117kgs fat) and yet am starting become someone who loves being out there. I've tried everything in the past; slimfast shakes, 5:2 diet, juicing, Russian airforce diet (so many boiled eggs it hurt), ketosis the lot. What has worked for me is not a fad or a shake or a 'diet' it's a shift in mindset.
 In 6 weeks i'm down to 105kgs (still 190cm tall). Here's what's been working for me:

The No CRAP diet. (It's an acronym)
Low Carbs (less than 100g a day) really read that package. Have a real life protein (meat/egg etc) with every meal as it makes you feel fuller for longer. Use protein a lot! I now snack on spicy chicken chunks or smoked sausage slices (high in fat though so be careful  of going crazy). More important than watching the Carbs though is the 'of which sugars' line which in the UK tells you what amount of the carbs are sugar. This leads on to the 'R' which is:

No Refined Sugar. I used to sleep loads in the day basically because i'd give myself a sugar coma at lunch and be exhausted at 4pm. I've been so much more energetic once I got passed my craving for it. I promise you there is a point where you stop thinking about wanting to cheat or binge. Cut it out of your diet and after a while your body will not want it as much.

No Alcohol (Well much less. There's so much sugar in a lot of it. If you want it go for Gin and tonic, clear spirits etc with Diet Coke.)

No Processed food. Make sure you know what you're putting in by making it yourself. Do you know what's in the packs you're eating? 

In the past I just cut out things from my life but found i always craved them and always gave in. 
Lifesaving swaps this time: Chocolate swapped for DARK chocolate (75 - 80% cocoa). Really savour a cube rather than bashing a whole bar. Roll it round your mouth, really taste it. Take in its subtleties and flavours.

Sweet potato (yam?) instead of normal potatos. Cut those bad boys thin, dribble them in oil and season really well. Oven bake until like crisps (chips?) and go mad on them. 

Diet Coke/drinks instead of other non - diet drink. I know they're full of crap but for that sweet tooth hit it's good and if weight loss is your aim realise how much sugar is in some of the liquids you drink.

Pasta for... well no swap found yet but I have been cooking and eating a lot of bacon and egg for breakfast (with mushrooms and tomatos) and well Bacon can be substituted for anything so that's my swap.

Brown rice instead of white rice. Brown rice still sort of sucks but it's better for you and if i add a lot of bacon i can kind of just taste bacon.

So other tips: KEEP A FOOD DIARY. By writing down anything in your book before you eat it you have another level of accountability. Don't lie to yourself. If you're not losing weight you're taking in more calories than you are using. It's just science. It's not your build, it's not your metabolism it's that your are cheating somewhere. Also find someone who terrifies you to be your weighing in buddy. Weigh in at the same time of day on the same surface in the same clothes and have that person know what weight you have lost. If they terrify you and haunt your dreams all the better as it will stop you eating crud.

Other than that. Just get up. I made excuses all the time. 'My kids, my work, my stress, my tiredness, my failures before etc.' Your couch is robbing you of the person you could be. Get up, lace up your shoes and start walking trying to hit 10,000 steps a day. Get a phone that counts for you and check it at 12pm each day. Adjust your afternoon activity level to make sure you hit the target. Find an exercise you love (i love swimming and tennis) and do them as it feels more like fun than work.

I've got a long way to go and am afraid of relapsing but this time it feels different and I'm looking forward to a longer life, doing more with my kids and basically being a sexy hot piece of meat this summer not afraid to take my shirt off on the beach for the first time. Ever.

Like 700 dollars or something like itI think it's definitely not a beginner exercise, but if you have the mobility I wouldn't consider it risky. I've had good experiences with them for the past 2 years.I don't breathe when I jog... Wait... I don't jog. That probably explains why I'm so fat. FmlErr...I think you might be missing your target audience.  This group is rapidly distracted by animated gif of cats.Im 210lbs and fairly buff,  fuck sweaters.[:0](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7s4BORuBe1A/UbuAvcrcajI/AAAAAAAAMW4/5ZdTOKkyB7Q/s1600/miss-j.gif)After being an intermittent gym goer for 6 years, I finally saw it. Someone working out in the squat cage with a sports ball and doing some tai chi. Nice dude, though. Let me in when I asked. 

Was doing some bent over rows and transitioning into straight leg deadlifts after with the same barbell. Some young guy comes in and starts doing the exact same thing... Not sure if he saw I was doing it or if he just coincidentally does the same thing. With lower weight. heh heh heh I had to giggle out "I'm not copying you, I swear" when I went to do more reps after a break to do some bench presses. Did you modify it or are you doing the vanilla program?On rough days, I will drink 3 pots of coffee. Cup size makes a difference, but that is a shit ton of coffee.http://lifehacker.com/exhale-on-your-left-foot-to-avoid-side-stitches-while-r-1503657354

reference.It's all based on goals imo. If you want the six pack abs and want to lower your fat% well you want to cut. If anything it depends on how comfortable you are with your strength. Personally unless you need to lose weight, I'd say bulk then cut. You are never gonna get those beginner gains again. Would suck to just lose thoseI was squating this week. First time I have used a belt in a long time so I was taking it easy and doing what I could comfortably do for 5's just to re learn it and build the pressure and tightness in my core...

I was so tight I ripped my shorts and underwear from hole to gooch. Still got some bench work in though before I left, so that's nice. \&gt;&gt;&gt;/fit/Yeah....I'm just gonna do a quick ab pump...You need to be able to do squats, deadlifts, and bench press. So get the things you need to do those first. /r/LiftingRoutinesI usually don't criticize people at the gym because there is a pretty great group of guys and gals in the weight room and no matter what if the people are there, they are trying to improve themselves. Except for this one fucker. This fucking old guy (55-60) can be seen at any pull up area (the resistance machine with the handles up top, the Olympic platform with the handles, the weight assist one) and I have only ever seen him do two things:stretch his hamstrings and do those stupid fucking crossfit pull-ups. He raises one leg up and stretches out each hamstring and then knocks out about twenty of those awful kips. I don't know why but it absolutely makes me want to scream. Last time I went over when he was done and did 5 form perfect pull-ups right in his eyeline to see if he would realize THEY AREN'T REAL PULL-UPS YOU LOOK LIKE A FUCKING JACK ASS!!Your body will not absorb and use all that protein unless you give it a use for that protein. 

Generally, keep it at 1g per pound of bodyweight. (some dude said protein stops being beneficial at even less than 1g per pound of bodyweight. He is wrong. It varies between individuals.) 

At some point, you're just turning your expensive whey protein into shit for no benefit. That is, if you're getting in like 250 grams of protein per day but only NEED 150g. 

So, if you're killing your muslces in the gym. Then by all means take a bit more protein. 

Oh, eat more whole foods too. Getting all your protein from one source usually isn't a good idea. Eat a chicken every now and then.Ask your doctor to change your medicine . There are other medicines for depression which wont have the side effect of sapping your energy. 
If you are getting dizzy becaue of a med effect. Food etc are not really gonna help  for long term.  
Just ask the doc to change the medicine to something more suitable for you. also stop working so much.Asking brah.You probably irritated a nerve. However, it would be best to talk to a doctor immediately.Went to work in with a guy doing T-bar rows. Put on an extra plate to get to my usual weight when it was my turn. Forgot I switched my routine and had already done bent over rows. Got two reps in, looked like an idiot trying to one up the guy and couldn't handle it. 

Told the guy I was doing drop sets. Wednesday I was doing cable flys at the gym.  Some guy comes up to me and asks how many sets I've got left.  I tell him I have several to go, but he can work in if he wants.  So he works in with me, then after about one set he lets some guy showing his girlfriend how to workout work in with us.  Totally threw off my timing for rests, and really, really ticked me off.  In retrospect, I should have began supersetting something when that started.You're signature is a G because you gangsta afSomeone from /r/Fitness  told the story. The thrower is not necessarily a redditor.Sounds seriousMan screw those people. As long as you're working hard and doing appropriate weights to your current level, then you're golden. How shitty of them. You're absolutely right, they are really soft.

The running have been pretty convenient for using on the treadmill to warm up for a few minutes before starting to lift, but I realize the're not the perfect shoes for squatting..

I'll try it without shoes next time, but I think I'll probably look some shoes with a flat sole for regular usage :)

Thanks!Be careful. You could be [RKO'D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKTaOvhVdg) at any time.&gt; the heels are very soft( for running that is perfect) 

Debatable.It's also a less efficient way to squat. Fuck crossfit in general. Like anything, it CAN be beneficial IF you use it correctly. But for most people, especially people who are starting to lift for the first time in their lives, it's the worst idea you could have. Look into [the recommended routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) from /r/bodyweightfitness 

On diet, calculate your TDEE, eat 300-500 calories over, then adjust after every 2-3 weeks as needed. See [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_fixing_your_diet) for more info4-5g Leucine has been shown to maximize MPS. And should be taken with a simple sugar.

1. breathe in through nose out through mouth. 
2. 3 steps in, 3 or 4 steps outLook at my post below. I'm giving the exercises.It's even worse for the bench press though. Since you shouldn't lift vertically on the bench but push the weight toward the rack...I took a week off and really didn't come back with the same strength.Fucking beast manLook at the exercises in the /r/xxfitness strong curves programLook at the exercises in the /r/xxfitness strong curves program**Lift and let lift**.

 I don't know why this is so hard for some people to understand.It never used to be a problem when I lifted at the small local gym, but I switched to the local YMCA because they're less puritanical about what bars can be used for what exercises and such. Just can't win.. Last week I roll up to the squat racks, two are occupied and one is empty but the bar has weights on it and there's a highschooler near it doing crunches. After watching his crunches turn into leg lifts I ask politely if he is using it, he says yes and goes back to ab workouts on the floor. 
A thin man at the next rack with about 130lb loaded overhears me and offers to let me work in. I'm thinking that's not much weight but a light workout is better than nothing. I silently judged him for the first two sets, patting myself on the back for being so strong. By the fourth set he was repping my max and removing his plates for my set was getting to be a pain in the ass. Spider curls. Though I normally use a bench for them.:') Don't use it for anything.We have a small gym at work. I can smell if a certain person is working out while I'm walking down the hall outside. I feel bad for people who have desks near the gym.For starters, I (21 F) work in a fitness center primarily used by people over the age of 60. Most of these people never worked out until they retired and their doctor suggested it, so I see all kinds of horrendous form. Many old men (for example, almost all of them) use the seated low row resistance machine as a lower back exercise. The keep their arms completely  straight and pull the weight with their lower back entirely. It hurts to watch. Since it's my job to help these people, I tried to explain to one man (very politely) that that exercise could hurt his back pretty bad and showed him the right way to do it. After him telling me that another guy with absolutely no weight lifting experience told him to do it that way and he thinks it feels good, I just told him I didn't want him to get hurt. 
How did he reply, you ask?
"Well you GIRLS just like to do different exercises than us MEN" 
At that point I walked away and proceeded to make a poster demonstrating the correct way to use the machine. I still see people doing it wrong. can I supplement micros with fiber and a multi vitamin? It's so ridiculous that maybe he wanted to listen to his own music when he was working out alone haha what a loser! And it's even better that you didn't try and help him and instead just made fun of him! Woo, what a dork! I bet when you started working out for the first time you just knew what to do exactly right 100%! The best part is that this total DWEEB might have had the day off and just came to the gym dressed so he didn't have to deal with the locker room! I work at a gym, tell management. She will be on thin ice forever. Tell them you are really dissatisfied and thinking of switching to another gym that has employees that are encouraging and want to help you to reach your goals. 

That would never fly at the gym I work at and should never take place in a health club from an employee. It makes my blood boil because I work really hard to show people anyone can workout and lose weight and that a gym isn't intimidating. Do you get a better ROM with a bench and a bar?  I have been doing them standing with a dumbbell, but not getting good results.  Maybe I should try it your way.That has to be a tough job..We have "that guy" at our gym, like every gym. He thinks he's the king. He's in his mid-50s, takes a whole corner of the locker room and lays out all of his toiletries, clothes, and like 5 newspapers. He sits in there for *hours* every morning, on his phone to various morning talk shows complaining about the government or the "liberals". All of this with no pants, covered in talcum. 

He is constantly spewing idiotic diatribes, but today was my favorite. In between saying incredibly inappropriate things about female spin instructors, he took the time to lecture a younger gym-goer on some sort of political debate. Said gym-goer was trying to change for work, so was a captive audience. While trying to explain the time period from whence this debate originated, he said, "it was Reagan, er...maybe Carter. I dunno. Same thing." I know that they were back to back, so if you're thinking that something happened in '80 or '81 it could be confusing, but if you're talking about a political debate, trying to sound like the local expert, please try and differentiate two of the most ideologically opposed presidents. 

Dude does some spin and then one of the ab machines. Spends the rest of his day making the locker room awkward as fuck. 

**TL;DR - Resident gym weird old guy considers himself an expert on all things political but confuses presidents with pretty opposing views. Yeah, but you don't have to be top end in anything. You don't even have to be competitively good in anything. You just need to do something. At the recreational level, assuming you're doing things correctly, the risks of injury are much lower.I only use smith machines for calf raises and occasionally shrugs.

Other than that, they force me into a fixed plane of motion and I don't trust them. I saw a drunk kid almost kill himself attempting to bench 135 lbs. He walked in, clad with street clothes, got half a rep before the bar fell onto his windpipe, then he got up and stumbled out of the gym. To anyone thinking I'm evil for not stopping him, I didn't know he was drunk until I saw him leave.So I accidentally put less weight on my bench press then I meant to. Thought I was doing 120, was doing 100. I thought, man this is really easy" so I kept going up to what I thought was 130 and I thought for sure I'd get to put plates on today! I was so excited, but that's when I noticed. I was so disappointed with what I'd done.
 All that confidence, gone. Then I took stuff off put 35 lb weights and then did 125, and this lady asked if I needed a spot because I added so much weight...no, no I didn't. TablespoonMy gym is very small. But the crowd is amazing! 1st day i joined, 2 guys helped me fix my squat. 

My gym makes everyone bring their towels so if they're using the bench, they put the towel on the bench and then exercise. Keeps stuff clean!Some people never grow out of their asshole-ish childhood mentality.  You keep doing you. Do not get hung up about it. 

Use that crushing experience as a weight, lift, get stronger. Mentally and physically- let fuel you to go harder and do better. Negative to positive. 

One day, after huge amounts of progress, make eye contact and laugh. Just laugh, without a reason, not at what their workouts. It'll make them self-conscious because they won't know what the heck you're laughing at. And that will be funny.

You could completely skip over that last part, though... I've had some serious setbacks gym-wise recently too, so I feel your pain. Literally. I hurt my shoulder benching 120 about a year ago and I still can't go over 80 pounds now. 

Just writing this out is making my shoulder throb from the memory. 

I wish I could have bitch slapped those women for you. Women do this all the fucking time at the gym. It drives me crazy. Turn it around on them bro. Let them laugh now but keep at it and put those bitches in their place at the end. It happened to me, now she practically begs for me to talk to her. Think of it this way, in one year they'll be the same but you definitely won't. Let them laugh now but you'll get the last laugh. Also just to say my understanding is that if you are in calorie deficit (to lose fat) you won't be building lots of new muscle. Any workout results might look small to start with though it will help with losing fat. Dude you've gotto findinternal validation Will do!

In which case would you recommend lifting shoes? Only in case I'm having issues with flat soles or are the generally preferred?

Thank you :)ATG squats, lunges, barbell hip thrustersIf you make it a priority you will find the time somehow... So far you have an excuse for every suggestion..Can someone confirm whether the deadlift video is a good source to try and copy form from?

Instead of squeezing my chest like the video tells us to do, I drive with my legs while pushing my hips forward. The two seem very different and I'm now really confused what I should be doing.I know this isn't moronic monday but what does "~" mean at end of the reps?Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

Hyped on caffeine, pretty good day :)Maybe your gym plays shitty music. It never showed up in my inbox till now lmao, no prob though Read the faq/wikiNo way. Maybe it's because I have long arms, or maybe I'm using incorrect form, but my all-time max bench press was 345, while my all-time max military press is 185.First of all, keep doing your thing man. You'll get there, before long they'll be mirin instead of laughing.

Second, I strongly echo telling management. I know, big boys don't tattle or whatever... but fuck that. The gym should know about employees that are so *blatantly* out of line and damaging to its clientele. If I were running a gym, I would absolutely want to know if any of my employees are being gigantic dbags.

And finally... the laughter's going to happen. It'll stop once you get to where you're going, but in the mean time... it's going to be there. Sorry dude. It sucks, but there will always be assholes. You gotta do your best to get some thick skin and shrug it off. Try to look at it as motivation: Fuck those people, show 'em you're not just a resolutioner.If the doctors said no lifting you should not do bodyweight work. Even if your body is lighter than the weights you use you are still exerting yourself which is what they want you to avoid. I only use the smith machine for shrugs and uprows they work more effectively than any other machines and dumbbells imo.Put up a sign:    "Grown Ups put their tools away.

I find him more trustworthy that he is willing to admit what he doesn't know and ask questions.I was at the Gym yesterday with my friend and were doing a set of incline bench.   Some guy comes up and asks if he can work in and of course we're both say yeah sure.   So we finish our 3 sets and are about to move on to the next exercise when the guy asks " Okay, what are we doing next?" 
So, apparently when he asked to work he didnt just mean for bench, he meant for every set of every exercise for the rest of our workout. Being the un-confrontational person me and my friend are we just let this guy work in for the rest of the workout. It's very possible, having read a bit about it now. It just surprised me at the time, and then the conversation afterward made it stick in my head all the more.I agree, it finally happened!I was just working my ass off trying to get a Chris Evans body. That will only come with daily lifting. Are you guys puffers? WTF man.well craigslist would be the best option if you get lucky but a lot of areas aren't great.

olympic plates: used on craigslist for under 70 cents a lb. alternatively you can get a "300 lb weight set" from dicks that has 255lb of plates and a bar and just not use the crappy bar that comes with it, or use it and get a better bar later and grab a nicer bench.

here's a better bench than the adidas I would recommend if you can afford it: http://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-flat-utility-benchI don't know of anything like that, but if you're willing to do the work I guess you could build a playlist with a mix of music and motivational sound bites.Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

Consistency is key but I feel that goes without saying.I also go to PF since there are no other gyms within my residence. The smith machine has a fixed and limited movement to some exercises and it's sort of hard to get properly set up. You can still squat and deadlift on the machine if you set yourself at an angle to the bar as well as the setting the bench aligned to the bar. Go heavy as you feel comfortable doing but wouldn't recommend going heavy as PF equipment breaks easily.Do we go to the same Y? I swear this happens every day at mine as well as other guys trying their hardest to be naked. Don't make it weird bro.Yesterday I went to a different gym because I was supposed to have a dinner date much closer to that one than my normal one. One of my buddies from work goes there.

Anyway, my date canceled and my buddy said he was going to do leg day. So I said fuck it and joined him (My normal leg day is Saturday).

He usually lifts light for volume and he psyches himself out before big lifts. I got him to hit a PR deadlift and a PR squat. Shit was fun, I hadn't worked out with another person since college. My peeve is when they don't un-rack the weights off the machines. And you're standing there like an idiot for a few minutes trying to figure out if someone's still using it or not. Pull up bar is a must.kinda both, in highschool and my parents buy my food and I just eat really clean 5 days out of 7 and slack on the weekends moreAnd you will also likely be in better shape at that ageI'm gonna be aggressive towards someone who makes 90% of his post about how OPs post is lame but himself is no better. OK that's pretty much what I figured. Had to ask, though.I took two weeks off to move, and when I finally got back to the gym (new one in my new neighbourhood), I had lost about 10% on all my lifts.  I was really bummed, but figured it shouldn't take me long to get back to where I was.

I spent a few weeks struggling at reduced weights, despite eating way more, and was getting frustrated.  I didn't backslide this much when I took six weeks off last summer!

So yesterday, I'm in my old neighbourhood to visit a friend, and popped into my old gym for a workout (still have that membership for another month).  And wouldn't you know it, I was right back at my old numbers for all my lifts, and set a PR on bench.

I think I'm sucking at the new gym because I don't feel comfortable there yet.  It's popular with serious bodybuilders, and I'm a little intimidated, and not willing to fail a lift.  Armed with this newfound realization, I'm going this afternoon and not making any excuses.  I know what I can lift, so I'm gonna do it.If I owned a gym and one of my employees did that, they'd be fired immediately.

Being mean is one thing.  Maybe it's not a *fireable* offense in and of itself.  But alienating my customers like that?  And customers who are just keeping to themselves and trying to better themselves?

Pack your things; good riddance.The fire alarm went off. Someone responds with: "...really? I'm tryna get my swole on!" I laugh hysterically and get stared down for five minutes.Dropped a 30kg barbell on my littlefinger, I thought I was going to lose my finger.Not me.

I don't care about anatomical guides, not for APT, not for deltoids, I care about how to train properly. If an anatomical guide is necessary, by all means, include it, but it often is just a load of extra information that is just that: extra information that muddles the important part: how to do the exercise properly.avocado (cut into cubes), swiss chard, cilantro, spring onion, goat cheese, salsa, black pepper, parmesan, olive oil (as a salad)How is that any more disgusting than drinking the milk of another animal?saw an extremely tan jersey shore looking bro dribbling a basketball by the free weights and wearing a "goin pro" shirtI'm 35. Horrible genes and a lifetime of breaking my body left me with brutal arthritis, ragged joints and a heap of tendon problems. I'm also ripped (well, as ripped as I can be, considering) because of the Smith machine. Almost all of my work is with it, including bench presses, because my body can't handle free weights heavy enough to work the muscles.
Sometimes kids at the University gym I work out at will come over and try to goad me into lifting "for real".  I just smile and decline politely. I can Smith machine bench 105 kilos, but can barely bench a bar without keeling over to one side Haha. Yeahhhhhh...that's because ....gulp...he does a lot of push ups....

I did three plates the first time I ever benched and it felt easy. I also do 1000 push ups a day for the last two decades like my hero did.Awesome, thanks!

Yeah, I didn't really change much besides lowering the bar position a bit when switching to low bar.. I thought the forward lean comes automatically from the changed bar position.

I'll probably try a wider foot placement and forward lean to see how a real low bar squat feels for me, but if what I was doing was mostly still a high bar squat I think I'll just keep it that way (and put the bar a bit higher on my neck again) as it feels pretty good and natural to me!

Thanks for the hybrid squat recommendation - never heard about that.. I'll play around with that! :)[I think it's pretty much universal.](http://s3.amazonaws.com/theoatmeal-img/comics/minor_differences2/7.png)coconut milk
I took my shoes off to do deadlifts, but didnt put them back on to put the weight away. Dropped a 45lb plate on the knuckle of my big toewould getting your elbows over the bar one at a time be considered a bro-up?&gt; Does it get used for squats? 

Not ideally, but I suppose you'll have to.

I only use a smith machine rarely and then I only use it for shrugs or pullups and rarely for calf raises. Do you go to Baylor? That sounds exactly like the gym at Baylor.What about the one for DB bench that says 3x8 ~ 1? Or maybe that's just a typo.snatch grip deadlifts wrecked my grip and forearms.

Every time I see her my heart starts pounding, mind clears out all thoughts and just focuses on her. I want to approach her but I'm terrified. Can anyone offer some advice?Brohr.http://youtu.be/bs_Ej32IYgo?t=8m32sYes, I've done this before. But I'm not a fan. I feel it's awkward with me. I prefer two handed I just started working out (only a week into it) from taking a year off. I worked out every single day in Afghanistan and came back in the best shape of my life. This past year I didn't work out at all. Luckily I didn't gain much weight but my muscular physique was no longer there. This is a preamble to this: just go work out and you'll feel so much better. You sleep better, your appetite is amazing, you feel better, have more energy throughout the day, and the list goes on.

I started working out again because I'm going to Taiwan for a couple months and I want to look good again in cut-off sleeve shirts and have that cut body again for the beaches. And in doing so, I feel amazing again (only after one week remind you). I'm just getting over that initial soreness, and it's alittle painful, but it'll pass.

My advice is to get up and do it. And I used to play WoW (accumulating 4 years on the damn thing) but I stopped and couldn't be happier. I look forward to working out again. It's not just a physical transformation but your mindset is transformed too. Dumbbells and bodyweight will be fine for most upper body work. And for lower body you can go a long way with dumbbells. As for how long, that's impossible to say, but you don't *need* to start off with barbells.So many things wrong with mr.asshole. I was hoping the small guy or someone else spoke up and the story ended up the bug guy got kicked out of the gym by the staff. That's because your stabilizer muscles need to do 0 work when you bench in the smith machine, you need to train the balance as well.Most people are going to have a hard time performing ab rollouts without a large degree of lumbar extension, which is essentially what you are trying to fix. You should have read the rest of my post bud. 

Yes. 

MY "favorite" of those types are the guys who decide to curl 20s while standing in front of the heavy weights. Then they get pissed off when you just charge over to put weights away. Sorry bro, turns out 85lb dumbbells are actually FUCKING HEAVY and you should get out of the way. "Yes"squatting, benching, overhead pressing and just about everything else safely without a spotter.

read the FAQ and look at recommended beginner programs- they consist mostly of bench, overhead press, squat, deadlift, and rows&gt;That will only come with steroids.The grip is cool on ohp and squaats tho.I was doing squats in the squat rack and this eye candy came up to me and ask if anyone was using the barbell behind me I replied no. As I was doing squats she asked if it was okay if she could do dead lifts behind me, sure not at all. As I finished my sets of squats, I wanted to do dead lifts so I politely asked if she wanted to switch our workout, she obliged. As I was doing deadlifts while she was doing squats in front of me, I literally couldn't see myself in the mirror because her ass is soo damn big. It was like 2 planets next to eachother about to align as one. I was so distracted I did 7 x 2 instead of 5 x 5. Went home and fapedYou were too nice. I'd just work on it anyway. Equipment hogging is plain wrong. you should have made small-talk.

you know, like brought up his Marine court-martial, how he spent a month in the brig, got dishonourably discharged and eventually lost out on the starring role in the direct-to-video debacle known as The Marine 3: Homefront due to his ignoble history with the USMC.

or maybe that time he got punched in the balls by a crazed fan in South Africa and collapsed like WTC7.I hear they finally got Halo: Master Chief Collection working so if you're into shooting some space marines, go pick it up bro. GTA Online Heists are actually getting a release this month as well.This. Also I see some kids in there, high school age. They want to show off and try to do too much weight. Their forms are off and makes me cringe. You got to get your ego out of the way and make sure your form is correct. Don't worry about other people, worry about you. If you got to lower the weight do it. Form is key, to me anyways "a" = "An indefinite article denoting one, but no particular, item belonging to a class or group."I was a swimmer as well. I tore my rotator cuff senior year but out of habit kept my calorie intake high. I was obese for a year before i realized there was a problem. Im at 15% bf right now on a bulk but was at 8 a month and a half ago. 

Listen to me: do not give up. That last bit of weight is going to be the hardest to lose and its going to be easy to tell yourself to just buy a fucking pizza instead of putting in the hard work. Stay motivated by watching some videos. 

Google the grind by tsu baseball. Thats a great video that always gets me pumped. Think about how ripped youre going to look. That would mean that all people gain muscle at the same rate, regardless of size. Which is pretty much the opposite of what I am suggesting. I think it would be easier for someone that's 6'5 to gain 1lb that it would be for someone who's 5'6.

Is there any research done on this topic?I only make it three or four days in advance, nothing more than that. But by the fourth day it still tastes good and I haven't died yet. I've found its great for standing calf raises if your gym has a plank of wood lying around.How is that dumb?  Treadmills are literally the devil.

Seriously, I know it's no fun but just carry those dumbbells three or four steps back to an area that's not in everyone's freaking way.

I absolutely do not care if I need to interrupt you mid-rep to get or replace my dumbbells, if you're standing in front of the rack.How can caffeine make the food in your stomach digest faster making you poop? Look up why caffeine makes you poop, that study sound like BS.
I felt the same way as well. I know keeping your neck like that is good so as to not cause neck injuries but i don't believe your chest always goes wherever your head does. Yay! Kitties!So I'm washing my hands. Guy comes up and starts washing his hands. He turns around and leaves. Doesn't dry his hands (weird) and leaves the water running full blast. I have had a fucking time trying to make sense of this.I saw someone put a bench parallel to the smith, lay under the smith with arms spread on the bench, and proceed to do several sets of hip thrusts. Didn't use the bar for a single thing. This was during the busiest time, too; people were waiting to use the other smith and the seven squat racks. It depends if you're talking about store-bought large cups or actual 6-oz cups.  9 larges from Starbucks would be a fuckton of coffee.  54 fluid ounces, or 9 standard coffee "cups" in the US, isn't a shocking amount of coffee.  It's a lot, but hardly unbelievable.I'd let it happen.For body building the norm is usually 6 days but 4 or 5 days still works well, but either way I think the caffeine and just the love of lifting works the best. I've been waiting all week for this thread. Okay so I was in the corner of the gym on the bench with a squat rack about 10 feet away and there was a guy doing box squats with 4 plates. Right beside the rack there was a girl doing T-bar rows. So the guy in the squat rack was done all his sets and unloading his weights and at the same time the girl walked over to the water fountain. This was his first time squatting four plates so he stupidly unracked the entire left side first and as the girl was walking back to the t-bar, all four plates and the bar came crashing down. The guy was just holding the last plate looking around in shock.

there is this persian guy who i always see at the gym, and occasionally we run into each other on the street. we don't know each other, the others' names, and etc., but whenever i see him at the gym or on the street, we always give each other a quick nod and resume business. Essentially the same as a [landmine press](http://www.leanitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/04landminepress.jpg) I suppose.Doh :DSomeone complimented my squat.  :)I was trying to help a brother out on his form, he was hunched way over doing bent over rows. Told him I wasn't trying to be rude but he was gonna mess up his back if he didn't straighten it out. He looked at me with sad puppy dog eyes and told me he couldn't, he had scoliosis. I feel like a dick.Use dumbbells. I find it hard to believe you can't lift a 5 or 10 lb dumbbell with out proper form.no, your comment does. Europeans , australians etc eat all those meats....

We are! I love it when people come to me about diet advice. Eating clean is fun I am picturing an urban ag zealot growing locally sourced organic asses in his front yard like a pumpkin patchI always used a chocolate flavor and mixed it with water, never milk. At first the taste will seem odd but just chug it and you should eventually get used to the taste/texture. protein barsThis happened today actually.  There were a bunch of dudes on reddit  talking about the gym instead of training.  None of them made any gains or got any stronger.  embarrassing story time.  i'd been lifting at home for awhile, but decided to get a gym membership so i'd have access to more equipment.
  
i  find myself back in the weight area, and seeing how all the benches were occupied, i got ballsy and went for the dumbbells.

i was gonna do some incline presses, and figured that 60 lbs would be easy enough (i'd only ever benched to this point, and was repping out ~160 x 5).  yeah right.  couldn't even get em in position.  55 was no-go either.  rep out a few 50's, manage a few more 45's, and then finally settle in at 40 lbs as my magic number.

this entire time, i'm surrounded by coeds (college town), frat bros, people bigger than me, and people smaller than me.  if laughter was had, i'll never know.  i had my headphones in and unless one of them came up to me to confront me, i couldn't have cared less what any of them think.

Ideally I'd just run back home but that may not be an option.The problem is that most of the milk that you buy in stores now are very processed and contains a lot of hormones (which I think they feed to the cow to get them to make more milk).    Also since humans are the only species that actually drink milk past childhood (and not even from our own species) there's been some debate over if we can actually properly digest it/if the nutrients in it are good for adult animals. That's the one that confused me, but I think you're right. Probably a typo. Thanks.It's almost certainly one of those 0.001% differences that broscientists thrive off of.

Genuinely curious ¯\\\_(?)_/¯LOL, that's how you know you're fit, someone downvoted you cuz they mad.

Like I said, it's possible, but how many years have you been lifting for?I do the best I can, and I do use free weights with super low weight to help, but my tendons and cartilage are deteriorating. I've been told to stop lifting altogether, but the Smith machine has given me a few more years. Stitches are fom incomplete breathing. They are a cramp in your diaphram. A lot of people have the habit of shallow breathing. One of the yoga practices is to breathnin for one count and out for two in order to counter this.

Practice emptying your lungs so you get used to it, then fill them completely. Then when you run, try the in one count out two counts technique until full breaths become a habit.

When you get into the habit of full breathing you'll find you breathe much more slowly and it kind of tricks your mind into calmness.Holy shit I'm just finishing an iced coffee black and have vanilla weigh in the kitchen.

Everyone is strong and the tools they have (literally any weight) are deadly blunt.What? So do Americans. What medication is it? Is it an SSRI? You don't have a butt plug? Bro, do you even squat?I like doing calf raises on a smith machine. If you go pretty heavy trying to move heavy weight onto a small platform to do your raises could be tricky with free weights. Its more of a safety thing for me I suppose. Great progress in my book. Miring that back picture.What do you mean? A true max is the most amount of weight you can lift according to the rules that govern what constitutes a lift. You'll often see some form breakdowns on a lift like that. Fiber is the best preventative measure you can take to avoid constipation. As many of the people have mentioned here, veggies are the best source and should not be eliminated from any healthy diet. To fix the issue in the short term, I would recommend getting some sort of stool softener like docusate sodium or Miralax. They're both relatively cheap and shouldn't contain any calories that might mess with your dieting. Plus one for short strides. You have your best mechanical advantage with a short stride.

i hope you managed to knock on some doors afterwards?Sloth hangs.  I think that its definitely less efficient as you don't have to balance the weight, but I'm not sure how it would make you conform to a non-natural range of motion. I've seen that mentioned here before and I don't really get it. If you are squatting properly, should the barbell follow a vertical line up and down? The smith machine does the work for you, in that regard, but wouldn't that mean if your squat form is good, its not big deal? I squat on the smith machine cause my current gym doesn't have a squat rack either. I'm just starting out, though so I'm probably missing some sort of nuance. I don't plan on doing it that way forever, but other than not working out the stabalizing/balancing muscles, is it really that bad for someone who is a little bit more casual?Did you read my post? I'm not convinced you actually know much about what you're talking about. Creatine contains more DHT than you'll possibly get from red meat, which is why people take it instead of just eating meat.

I usually mix casein in with whey because I don't like the texture of it straight.  If you want good protein stick with ON Gold Standard, BSN Syntha, Cellucor or MusclePharm.  Personally I stay with ON Gold Standard and BSN Syntha.  Chocolate is usually the preferred choice it seems but there are many awesome flavors available.  If you like cappuccinos ON has one that is amazing.  I think they even has a cinnamon roll one that is supposed to be amazing.  Unless you can find a decently priced local store bodybuilding.com and Muscle and strength have the best prices on average.Thank you so much!! :)it would just be much more practical and cheap though.. i'm not looking to get massive, just to get some muscle that shows. Will it take too long with only dumbbels or is it actually a solid idea just to use dumbbells?*heh*The scene with the titular line, by far. "Gee, I'm so tired of the Terminafor." Milk, almond butter, and bananaI had a hard time breathing while running.  I would breath from my mouth the whole time and couldn't for the life of me keep it closed. I'm only a mouth breather while running. Then I found breathe right strips. The nose strips for snoring. Once I started using those while running, I was able to find a comfortable rhythm.  I'm lucky in the sense that I work an office job and have a break room with a fridge. I keep groceries at work so I'm never without anything. I also have a little machine at work that hard boils eggs too.Currently getting these stomach virus gainz. 

shit fucking sucks. Ah yeah that too , I am always skeptical of anything that would allow to lift or do significantly more weight than I would with free weights , I usually just assume it'd be better for me to just lower the weight until I can do it with proper form using free weights but that's just my anecdotal experience . 
Well first I want to applaud you for taking the initiative to start working out despite some limitations. What you're doing is not bad by any means, so don't let anyone tell you differently. You're doing something consistently which is great, but I think you could do it more efficiently.

Personally, if there were 2 lifts I would not want to sacrifice, it would be squats and deadlifts. Ideally, you would have a power rack, (olympic) barbell and plates, and a bench. That would enable you to do the primary compound movements. I have a half rack thing from Dick's that was a little more than $200, and got an olympic barbell and plates from Craigslist for $180. There are alternatives for now. If you look at exrx.com, there will be exercises you can do using the equipment you have already. Also, as was already suggested there's bodyweight routines too. **BUT**, if you want to bulk and add mass then it's really going to be best to be able to do the compounds where you can move the most weight.

As far as your current routine, it seems to be more in line with bodybuilding, as in prioritizing hypertrophy and aesthetics. That's based on the rep range you're using. I personally have been doing a 3x5 program which prioritizes strength, but will incidentally cause hypertrophy too. In a little more than 2 months my lifts have increased like crazy and I've gained about 12 pounds. But again, there are alternatives. While I'm more in the camp that wants to build a strength foundation to maximize hypertrophy work, there are people who will go straight for the hypertrophy using higher reps and volumes like you have been. As long as you're able to progressively overload, that's progress. There's a few other things I won't address yet since this is already a lot of text, but feel free to ask anything.

Your assessment for diet sounds pretty accurate to me, but if you haven't then definitely calculate your TDEE. I'm 5'8 and started at 150, and have been eating 3000+ daily, but I know that's well above what is necessary. I basically went from light cardio to no cardio wanting to really maximize the bulk, but I'm going to be adding in cardio again now. I just think of it in terms of calories, so for you I would just want to be sure that whatever cardio you do isn't putting you below your intake goal.Powdered peanut butter. IIRC, Macros are like 45kcal 6c 1f 4p per 12 gram serving. Mix it 2:1 PB2:Water for a really low calories peanut butter clone, or throw it in shakes or other recipes for a peanut butter taste. Good stuff.my deficit is 20%. thats around 4-500. my body fat percentage can swing by as much as a percent up or down each day so I average several days to see a trend. I reservations about trying a smaller deficit are that the macros /calories/serving sizes in my fitness pal might be off (has happened in the past). 400 calories gives more room for error. 
Its interesting that you talk of sleep since I have recently spoken to a doctor about it. Recently I don't feel like I am getting the amount and the quality that I need. I will focus on it Since besides lowering my deficit(cautiously) that may be the only things I may be able to do about itThat's awesome man...Gotta get them buddy gainzI do 3:2 ratio. 3 inhalations, 2 exhalations for every step I take.Sorry things havent been going your way, one internet stranger to another, if you have any questions about python feel free to pm me, I have a decent amount of experience with it.I am terrified of this, it's why my lifting schedule revolves around what time I poop that day The award is not having people that do that.I once saw a 93 year old smash his age group's world record for the 1000 freestyle at a Masters swim meet. Dude had on 3 different joint braces, and was still swimming when the next event was going on. I only hope I am still able to swim when I am 93, if I am lucky enough to get there.That's why we were given two hands. "For when you cannot left, you surely can right" - Abraham Lincoln

The quote might be a little off...Not experienced these feelings with working out, but with other life-related stuff. You're probably overwhelming yourself and thinking you have to do everything at once (probably goes something like this; "Maaaann, I have to get back to the gym.....and start eating healthy......but I feel so out of shape....uugh I have to deal with buying a membership...how do I fit the time into my schedule, I don't have the time to eat healthy, there's so much to do AUUUGHHHH I CAN'T DO IT!")

So. Breathe. Baby steps. Like /u/whiskeyfritz said, one step at a time. Go once a week. That's it. Easy, right? Then, 2 or 3 weeks later, go twice a week. Then 3 times. Then 4 times. Now relax...just enjoy going 4 times and take it easy. *THEN* worry about your diet. Buy some more fruit on your next grocery trip. Gradually finish eating the junk food in your house, but don't replace it - or, replace it at a slower rate than you're eating it.

You see what I mean? It's OK OP. You'll get back on the wagon. Just don't try to do it all at once or else you might end up like [this](http://makeagif.com/1Wa-3l)I just beat Dying Light, and am currently hooked on Far Cry 4.

My body is about halfway to where I want it to look, I've finally passed double plate squats and deadlifts, and the world was becoming my oyster. One of the guys I lift with even commented on how big I was getting (a dude with a huge beard and dual tattoo sleeves, easily the manliest guy I know). 

Then I nearly tore my ankle in half on Thursday playing basketball. Doctor says I'll be off physical activity for 4-6 weeks and will probably be limping for at least 2. 

I'm scared I'm going to lose it all...I do, and it's working fine for me (as a novice). Except for when I eat out which isn't often, I'll have the same thing for breakfast, second breakfast, brunch, lunch, and second lunch every day.Thats a lot of volume on your monday. Your doing chest/tricepts/shoulders/biceps in one day. This in my opinion is going to hinder your development cause certain muscles are not getting the attention they need. Tricep development is huge for getting past bench sticking points. Split your days up better, and put more focus on to your triceps, more volume in your dips and try barbell skull crushers. I also found switching to flat DB press for awhile and coming back to BB press with additional tricep work helped me out.This post has [too little content](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_3._posting_rights_require_minimum_qualifications). **Add more text to the body and then [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFitness&amp;amp;subject=Please+reapprove&amp;amp;message=http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2y960d/whats_better_for_gaining_muscle_mass_high_reps/%0A%0AI have added more content.)** to have it approved.

1600/1300, which is it? whats your currently weight and height? Activity level also factors in(how many times a week are you training?) To me it seems low. Ask your trainer these questions.A year ago I was at 270. I started eating right and 25 lbs flew off. I think you'll find the next stage quite a bit more difficult.Know your routine. If one thing is taken, do your next exercise and come back to it. 

Ask people how many sets they have left. If they're taking long breaks and doing a weight close to yours, ask to work in. "Yes"Finally saw the xx version of a bro doing curls in the squat rack - some dame dragged a mat all the way across the gym to do yoga poses in front of the mirror in the weight room. I know that feeling. 

I was in the army for 6 years and working out is part of the job. After I got out I dident work out for a solid 2 years and got fat and now I'm just getting back into it. 1 month in. For me it started out just wanting to lose some weight. Nothing stressful. 

So my routine was simple. Go to gym. have fun. 

I literally had no set routine. I would go and jump on the elliptical one day for 30 minutes and just cruise and watch the tv. Or walk in the treadmill or bike. And I never had a plan I would one day go over to the squat rack and squat some weight what ever it was 90lbs whatever. And after a while after the sims started going away I started lifting more and found a routine. Never paying attention to anything else. 1 step at a time like I had never worked out before in my life. Just slowly rediscovering working out. No need to go crazy. No need to walk in with a plan for everything. Just go have fun. I'm not an expert at cleans, I do power clean and press as my main OHP movement and haven't had that issue.

 It sounds like you're pulling the bar straight up like an upright row, when you should be leaning back during the motion as you pop your hips forward to initiate the pull. I'm not sure I'm explaining it well.....

You should be hinging forward from your hips a bit at the start of the pull. Hinge from your hips, humping the bar while pulling up and back, this kind of creates and counteracting force that keeps the bar path vertical and your upper body will be leaning a little bit back. When the bar gets to the apex, you pull your upper body back under and the bar lands on your delts.

I'm not sure if that explains it well enough, but there you go.No, must have missed that.. Got a link? 
Mine was carpal release on the left hand, very quick operatiom and very very effective. One of the older guys who looks like he's a powerlifter (or at least used to be) deadlifts crazy weight on teh smith machine. Always wondered why...Great form, only thing i see is you get a bit lazy on the way down and you loosen everything up, the bottom portion of the lift is just as important, especially once you start dealing with some heavy weight.

The only major thing to worry about is *micro*nutrient deficiencies. Vitamin *arbitrary letter here*, iron, magnesium, Calcium, all that good shit.

Also, Omega 6:3 ratios. Things like deep-fried chicken have primarily Omega 6s, things like wild salmon have a lot more Omega 3s in them. You need both types for basic hormone functions, but Omega 3s are much harder to accidentally get enough of.

But, you realize that there's a limit on how fast muscle develops? So that 9 pounds is likely mostly fat.

Otherwise, yes read the wiki.Are you refering to the deadlift or the squat? 
Thank you for the advice.Thanks I appreciate the kind words. I get this sometimes. I take it as an indication that my form was slightly off for some reps. I wouldn't worry unless it gets painful or it doesn't go away after a week or so. Got back in the gym this week after a few days off to recover from a cough/sore throat. Ripped a couple of calluses on my hand when deadlifting (with chalk.) I think I need to start using straps. 

And I've now been benching with a reverse grip for almost a month, and my 5RM is almost up to my 5RM with a regular grip - except with none of the shoulder pain now. Benching's become a lot more fun now.Don't ever let this bother you. Never sacrifice good form for heavier weight. That is ego lifting. Just keep grinding and do what you got to do. They will be 'mirin' in no time! best of luck!That sounds great, thank you for the fresh perspective and for posting your thoughts. :)I'd say just take a break and deal with it, if those are doc's orders. You're better off losing a few lbs on your lifts rather than risking injuring yourself.

They're like magnets to people who don't kmow wtf they're doing.Don't leave your gym bag around him.You weren't really fat to begin with - it's just the dumb way you're pushing your stomach out in the photo. You should have bulked or at least lifted at maintenance for a while.  The first question in the FAQ says this:

&gt;At this rate, your goal calorie intake = TDEE - [BWlb x 3.2kcal] (or TDEE - [BWkg x 7kcal]). This is a good place to start.

Start there.Hey everyone, I am launching a startup called [supplement box](http://www.supplementbox.co/). I am very passionate about supplements. In my free time I love researching supplements, reading new studies about fitness, and health, browsing supplements, nootropics, stackadvice, fitness, and examine, etc. 


I decided to start supplement box in order to help other people experience the benefits which supplements have brought me. One thing that frustrated me about how supplement industry worked was that I would have to spend $20-$40 to buy an entire bottle of a supplement which may not work for me either due to flavor, side effects, or my personal chemistry. Because sometimes supplements which work for one person don't work for another. Since everyone's chemistry is different, some people get good results from one supplements and not another. 


Due to this, in order to try a handful of different supplements, it would cost a few hundred dollars, and i wouldn't have certainty that I would get good results. If i didn't get good results, i'd be stuck with an entire supply sitting on my shelf. 


My solution was to figure out a way to let people sample a supplement in a small quantity before buying an entire bottle. To do this i partnered with leading supplement suppliers. Each month we send our subscribers a box containing 6 new supplements. Each box contains a balanced sampling of supplements from the following categories: Nootropic, Muscle Building, Weight loss, anti stress, energy, and bonus. Subscribers get to try and experiment new supplements, curated by our team. The subscription renews monthly, users can cancel anytime, and shipping is free. If your happy with the samples you receive, we encourage you to visit our partners and purchase a full supply. This way you get the benefit of discovering new supplements each month without spending too much. 


Right now we are growing our supplier base. We currently have 9 suppliers on board, and are in talks with many more. As we grow our subscriber base we will be able to include better supplements in each box and work with more suppliers. We are set to launch in a couple months and are accepting pre-orders on our first month supply (limited to 50 boxes). In celebration of our upcoming launch we are offering a 50% discount for the first 3 people who PM me. The next 10 will receive a 30% discount. The next 10 will receive 20% discount and so on. Any suggestions, critical feedback is highly welcome either through pm or comment below. that's exactly what I do actually lol&gt; he uses the elliptical like a scooter

Gotta admit, I LOL'd at thisWhat kind of muscle you want? Long lean endurance muscle or do you want short, thick power muscles?

The problem with this is that you are putting your shoulder in fairly severe internal rotation, which, if you have any initial deficiencies, will cause pain almost immediately.  And even if you don't, you will develop them; google "weightlifters shoulder".

Having that acid sitting on your teeth like that is not good for the enamel.There's this tiny, old, native guy that goes to my gym, he is literally there all the time, it's like it's his second home. He comes in the morning, leaves at night.  But this guy,  he doesn't know how to talk, I'm not dating he speaks another language,  he literally doesn't speak *any* language. He doesn't lift, he only plays basketball, and he's constantly going around saying the few words he knows, "play a game?" I think he may have a mental disability, but nobody knows. Literally everyone our gym of a couple thousand people knows who this guy is. Well one day,  he was playing pickup ball with some kids, (this guy is like 60 and 4"10) and apparently the kid wasn't following the rules. The guy straight up punched the 10 year old kid in the face. Obviously he was kicked out of the gym, but nobody pressed charges. Everyone felt a little bad for the guy,  obviously what he did was wrong and illegal, but I don't think he's right in the head, and this gym is his entire life. So after a few months of this guy begging to be let back in, they finally do, out of pity. About a week later he punched another kid in the face. Needless to say, little Indian dude won't be coming back.I'm a relative newbie in the free weight section, because I'm a girl and it's always full of dudes (plus I'm relatively weak!). Anyways, I finally mustered up the courage to start strong lifts this past weekend.

On Monday, I go in and the usual guys are in the weight room. Okay, whatever, take a deep breath and do yo thang. My university gym only has two power racks and one bench, so it's pretty small. One rack was free, but there was stuff near it, so I asked a couple of dudes standing around chatting if anyone was using it.

They gave me the weirdest looks, like I was even dumb for asking! I don't know if it's just cuz I'm a girl in the weightroom or what, but man, that has bugged me ever since.I wish. Unfortunately work isn't easy to come by here currently, if it was 10 years ago I would have left after the first few months of my schedule, but having a family and everything now I can't afford to miss days, I usually cash my vacation days in at the end of my calendar year (November because that was my starting month) and spend half on Christmas and put the other half into savings, still waiting on the day I can get a promotion and have a weekend to appreciate my family, until then I'm stuckI have access to about 6 other gyms more equipped with the deal im on.  The one I use Is only because it's a five mins drive.  Ill choose the ten minute drive now.  I've seen similar hate for leg press as for smith machine.  I'm not telling you what to do, just repeating what I've heard, but the general theory is that if you're lifting to get stronger for real world situations (e.g. moving furniture) where you don't have something guiding the motion, you want the stabilizing muscles to be strong in addition to the prime movers.  The stabilizers are worked by squatting/deadlifting, but not by a smith/leg press machine.Super Cheese Donairs.  Did wonders for me, I gained a bit more than 50 pounds in a year.

I don't know why you're trying to gain "fat", but generally speaking you might see some gains from something along the lines of GOMAD "Gallon of milk a day", remember though, that's per day, not in one sitting, don't make yourself puke trying to drink it all at once.He meant NSFSG 

Not safe for sick gainsI did ten dips in a row with perfect form for the first time in my life!The reason as to why I do alot of one handed bicep/forearm exercises is because my arms are slightly uneven and I've found that using dumbbells really helps me even them out.You're running too hard.  Either your fitness will catch up, you need to slow down, or you learn to live with the discomfort.  You shouldn't need to think about breathing, your body can do it without you putting any conscious effort towards it.  I was a college track guy and my son is now.  No one ever gave us one instruction for breathing, not ever.  Actually nobody knows what exactly side stitches are except that they happen when you're going hard.

Bottom line: don't worry about it./r/dadjokesThis sounds like an injury and not a cramp. I would suggest icing it and if it hasn't improved by the game later taking it easy resting frequently.Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

Recently they hired a new guy that works behind the counter. it's the owners nephew. This guy creeps out all of the women and even some of the guys' for example. He will get peoples names when they scan there cards and then try to friend request them on FB and look up there instagram and shit. Then when you walk into the gym He will ask questions about stuff that he saw posted on FB walls. for example He asked my GF how her friends (that he has never even met) Birthday party was. She asked how he knew her and he said oh I saw that you were going on your FB wall. One time he walked into the women locker room 10 minutes before the gym closed and walked in on a girl getting changed. she complained to the front desk but no one did anything because he is related to the owner. he just generally is a weird dude. he will walk around the gym and stare at people. try to but into everyones conversations. he even rearranged the mirrors so that he could look into the back of they gym while he is at the front desk. Well I want to get an overall bigger body, so I'd have to say short thick power muscles.Love your turn of phrase!Bad for the throat too, if you do this a lot. There's an episode of My Strange Addiction where a guy was addicted to consuming massive quantities of vinegar.

Not exactly excuses, as much as time conflict, and most suggestions I've looked at openly, including the yoga, and gym membership, I can try to bike from my door to my truck but 20 ft won't help me, much like your postDid you even read his post?If a thread of 99 percent of the people are recommending chicken. I assume American. Because stereotypically your cuisine sucks. Lol.  You are a young country. It's deep fried or BBQ chicken lol and like you said maybe a Texan steak. Your Texan BBQ are really good though fyiI learned two things at the gym this week:

1. My gym's plates can be the same size but different weight.
2. Squatting with different weights on each side is not good for you........ and then?I've thought about it because I've seen it happen no less than 3 times. But it's the Y so I'm not sure they'll care. You don't have a high metabolism, you are overestimating how much you eat. A good rep range for hypertrophy is 8-12 reps at a weight that is heavy for that rep range. Of course strength training will bring some size and hypertrophy training will bring strength.I see SQUATZ and I see DEADS

but where are the OATS

Either way, I feel like I just hit a PR watching these vidsBrahldr?
Doing both is beneficial. Muscle confusion may be cliche but it is real. I had major surgery last week and not allowed back in gym for another 5... I feel ya!Highbar ATG or GTFOThat looks great, I was also interested in the rowing machine that's on house of cards? That looks like something I could fit 15-20 min into and not die lol, thanks!I know it's never nice to hear things like that, but why ru giving so much worth to what these random people  ru saying? Who gives a shit what they say.......they don't know you, what your doing, or your circumstances. I've only recently started benching after after taking 2 years off (shoulder problems) and am using only lightweights to perfect my form. Ask yourself, is it better to have the respect of these 2 random ,judgemental morons or to have perfect form that can translate into a better bench press in the future? You do you and don't worry about what others think, cause frankly those 2 random people prolly don't know shit anywaySaw a bro going to take the plates off his barbell only to watch him toss them all on the bench he was using and walk to the change room.

Good articles I write about fitness and other topics

I just decided to "switch" my instagram to be more fitness oriented.Sorry never heard of it but I'm stateside also.  I make protein smoothies with strawberries/mango/banana/peanut butter and more.  It just depends. I would personally google protein smoothies or protein shake recipes and find ones that sound good.  Here is a nice link.


http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/proteinshakes.htmI had a guy deny me use of the squat rack because he wanted to use it for pull ups (not even using the bar). I told him that he was being retarded. If I didn't have anything else to do I would have just taken the rack. Protein Cookie Dough Quick &amp; Easy: http://youtu.be/tA9k6vULyL4My school had 2 power racks for 35,000 students. The football team had over 60.Start learning to swim better, and also to swim other strokes. Then you can give yourself more challenging sets. An hour can be plenty for a workout if you're swimming nearly constantly, whereas if you just sort of swim when you feel like it and hang on to the wall you won't get anything. 

Learn to swim better (more efficiently) and learn other strokes. Then start planning out your exercises: You should go in with a printed list of what stroke you're swimming for what distance, how many repetitions of that, and a time interval for how long it should take you and how long you will rest. Nearly every exercise pool has a big clock to count you're time so you should be good to go. 

Believe me it is much easier to push yourself when you have a structured workout already planned. This is like a gym bro version of "Code Monkey" by Jonathon Coulton.You squatted the crap out of your legs, good session bro embrace the gainzI had a mixed feeling of "Awww poor guy" and the urge to chuckle at the image of someone doing push-ups outside of a closed gym. Either way mad propsRisky click of the dayI do also take a multi and fish oil. &gt; What is the best food to get fatter fast?

Anything calorie-dense that you can cram down with ease. If you can manage to eat 200g of any type of nuts then that's over 1000kcal right there.

&gt; but it's really hard to count calories and stuff like that.

Just get a kitchen scale and start weighing your food. Unless you mean that you're not the one preparing your own meals, then it  shouldn't be that hard at all. Even if that's the case, it's not a gigantic problem. Just eat whatever you normally would and then add in, for example, 500kcal worth of nuts every day for 2-3 weeks. If you're not gaining weight, bump it up by another 200-300kcal. Rinse and repeat until you're gaining weight.As does mine, i saw a young kid, maybe 14 or so, trying to put a bunch of dumbells away and hurt himself.Hyde is motivation in liquid form broThen make sure you get sufficient recovery time. Rest days exist for a reason. You don't build muscle when you lift, you break it down. It builds when you rest.I was lucky enough to get mono in my first week of this semester. And also, make sure not to go back to lifting for at least a month. Bad stuff can happen if you don't wait for everything to go away, even if you feel fine.Man, don't be that guy ...you are going to kill yourself working that much. then your family will be out a parent... I know it seems important to get that money but really being with your family is more important. cut something out of your families life. make do with less... if only to save yourself for your family later.&gt; My GF was impressed and said I'd be laid if we weren't staying at her grandma's

Always get it in writing. 
Heavy weight, few reps.  As few as 4 if you're achieving muscle failure. Muscle confusion is not realWhat inspired such rage? http://youtu.be/Pbyq77I6RRM

I do mine like this. I can't tell you the amount of men who cozy up right behind my bench, though, and then if I glance back there's a whole lot of guy butt or guy front right there. 

I've seen people say this is good form and people who also say I'm wasting my time. I like it though. I only feel it in the triceps and they've improved so... I guess whatever works. I know about the balancers, it doesn't concern me very much because to be honest I lift for aesthetics, and anyway if I need to supply with some extra work for the core, I can do so. What I'm concerned with is the possibilities of creating muscle imbalances and/or joint stress.

What took me away from the smith squats is that apparently, the forced path you take up and down can harm a lot your knees if your body's natural movement deviates even a little from the "standard" motion the machine was made for. While the leg press seems to be equally bad for stabilizing muscles,  it doesn't seem any worse than regular squats for joint stress on the knees. 

That's not to say that I wouldn't use free weight squats if given the chance; it's just that in my current situation the only possibility for doing squats is power cleaning +front squatting without any safety measure, and I think it's not worth it for me.Not single leg but Trap Bar deadlifts from the low handles worked for me and had great carry over to my squat. Initiate the lift by squeezing the glutes.I'd go with a 10 lb plate. Big enough to get some whipping action but still light enough to get some good velocity behind itI do full body. But I'm still in my first year of lifting.I have 2 tablespoons with water and orange squash (for taste). Ive also read your meant to drink it through a straw to save your teeth's enamel.No worries! I'm a very inexperienced runner and switching to a shorter stride has really improved my posture and overall running technique. 


Basically my "coach" (my friend who happens to be a coach) means that running with a shorter stride is similar to running barefoot which is what humans have always done. Try running barefoot and you'll notice how you automatically take shorter strides and attempt to run more fluidly by beginning the stride on the front part of your foot. 

Also having shoes that have a thin sole and low heel helps with the natural running. It takes some practice and you'll probably feel it more in your calves than before, but overall it's quite a nice experience. 

Happy to help!! Not only did I bench 225lbs for the first time, this past Sunday, but I was able to do it for 2 full reps. I felt like a god among men!Yeah, I would think where a 5'9" dude could be limited at 0.5lbs of muscle gain per week, a 6'7" dude could do 0.75lbs per week or maybe even more.What if people think you're desperately trying to unstick your balls from the side of your leg??Ah, right. Because any reduction in fat must come from starving yourself. Are you fat, perchance? You sound fat.Stop spewing bullshit manCan you burn muscle? Just joined golds gym and this guy who signed me up and works for the gym said you can burn muscle while giving me the tourWhen I was working out with the highschool football team, a pair of kids were messing around, chasing each other around in the gym. One of them decided it would be hilarious to pick up a 45 pound weight and throw it at the guy he was chasing. After the crash, the gym was rather silent, other than the guy with the broken leg sobbing. Then the coach started yelling what we were all thinking, "What the fucking fuck did you think was going to happen?!?"

Both of those kids are still idiots to this day.The cardio/erg row right? I love that thing, works back loads.Friend in army came home and told me this. This has worked wonders with finding my stride.I gotta agree, just like the 300 actors, they weren't so big and bulky, rather skinny and defined.No... no it is not.Just take the stuff he's not currently using. That's what I use to do.This is easily my favorite gym related comic on the Internet. Hey man 185 fully muscular to 255 is not *that* bad, I've been and seen much worse, no need to feel bad. 217 is really close to home, keep up the good work!NSFG Not Sane For GainsYou're buddies now? That came out of nowhereThat's very nice of you. I go to a gym, so the variety of exercises possible is almost limitless. The boredom comes mostly from the strict aerobics regimen. I will forego weightlifting if there is a time constraint and without some form of distraction, would not persist. 

I'm sure your parents are aware of the proven mental acuity improvements that come with regular exercise. The thing is to get them started doing something. Walking a dog, joining a hiking club to add a sociability factor, learning to dance, golf, parking further out in a shopping mall, Jazzercize, Zumba, martial arts are just some of the things that come to mind. Finding something where a slow start is not perceived by them to be "lesser" or embarrassing.

I had never been in a gym before the age of 53 and was highly self-conscious about being a fatty amongst the buff. But, I found out nobody cares, no one looks, no comments, some people even help when you're about to do something assinine in the weight room. Also, going into the locker room was a non-issue. one tends to invent all sorts of barriers that don't actually materialize after the first step has been taken.

I hope you can persuade them to find an enjoyable outlet. It generally takes about 3-4 weeks of doing something daily for it to become a habit. Perhaps buying a wearable exercise monitor can help them develop goals. If I can help further, please don't hesitate to ask.Go to the dentist you fool! Pull sumo, eat buttOk. I just got the Adidas Powerlift 2.0s and I like them, but I've used Vans before and had no problems. I originally used a pair of tennis shoes, but once I got to around a 245 pound squat they were really wobbly and made me stall.  
  
I mean you look pretty stable at this weight, but you might have problems soonThat makes sense, thanks!What did you do wrong? You hit yourself in the fucking chin, that's what you did wrong. Seriously, you are over-thinking this. Next time, try but to put your head in the way of the bar. You are right. This would be the sensible thing to do. Maybe I just needed somebody to tell me that my hard earned gains wouldn't be gone forever. Thanks man!
Yea I've thought of doing that just wasn't sure if the rows were necessary. Thanks!Preaaach. Today at the gym I watched I guy put his plates back in the wrong order, set after set after set. I literally made eye contact with him as I picked up all his plates and put them back in the correct places.

Maybe I'm OCD. But fuck is it really that hard to put your 45's back with the 45's, 25's back with the 25's, and not hide your 10 lbs and 5 lbs behind the 35's?I didn't think of the posture thing, thanks!I recently got a Keiser M3 Plus after reading some [reviews at bodyGearguide.com](http://bodygearguide.com/best-spinning-bike-reviews/) and honestly, it was a great investment. It was a little out of budget but I figured that if I'll spend good money then I probably improve my chances of using it more often and it seems to be working. :DI guess I'll be the one to post [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHBLxCPmnVc)I tested out some of my wife's milk once.

I don't believe half of you guysI noticed among races it appears to be most common for Asian people to work out in street clothes. Whites come in a close second but it seems to be more common for white people to put on a workout shirt but remain in jeans.

How can anyone work out in blue jeans comfortably?This is a really complicated question, but for the time being, we will just say no. If you work out, unless you have incredibly low levels of fat, you will not burn muscle.

Just for simplicity sake, you will not burn your muscle if you work out.Did you even read the article you linked?

&gt;But don’t get too hung up on analyzing all the nutrient interactions. “I think you can obsess too much over how you combine nutrients,” says Dickinson. “Some people schedule their intake of different foods at precise times throughout the day to avoid any conflicts, and that’s definitely taking it too far.”In terms of speed, heavier weights will definitely help leg development and growing muscles fast. *But* skill is an issue, so while you're learning skills, it makes sense to work with lighter weights. You probably won't *need* heavier for at least a year if you're creative, but if you have the money to spend, a few months in, you can upgrade your set up with a squat rack, barbell, bench press.

You should ask /r/homegym for a second opinion though, tbh. I don't know my shit.Pull sumo, eat buttOh my fuck ahhahahThere's gold for thatRead the sidebarhttps://i.imgur.com/QWkNHh.gifHere's my breathing style while running:
- 2 counts inhale through the nose
- 2 counts inhale through the mouth
- 4 counts exhale through the mouth
- repeat

Starting through the nose encourages deep breathing and "directs it" to the bottom of your lungs. The key here is breathing into the belly -- you want to see and feel your diaphragm dropping (which ends up looking like a protruding stomach).

But I find that just breathing through the nose doesn't give me the volume of air that my lungs want/need. So I "top off" by breathing through the mouth. The key here is a seamless transition between the nose breathing and mouth breathing. There's absolutely no pause in between -- it's almost as if the nose is still taking in air while you start breathing through the mouth. 

By the end of those four counts of inhaling, you've taken in a lot of air. Exhaling at a consistent rate over the next four counts will release the pressure while still allowing for proper absorption of oxygen in the lungs. The key here is not to release all the air at once -- a steady stream over all four counts is the goal.

And, at all times, air should be either moving in or moving out. This is easily overlooked, but perhaps the most important aspect of proper breathing. Don't ever inhale or exhale so quickly that you've run out of space or run out of air -- this essentially short-circuits a proper breathing cycle. 

I focus almost solely on my breathing while running. It's meditative and, actually, very relaxing. The above method may not work for everyone, but it has proven very effective for me. Retract **AND DEPRESS** the scapulae.Cheers, I'm not sure how much this helped but I used to be really bad and just didn't like leg raises. Therefore I made myself do sets of them with each workout and now there my favourite ab exercise. The increase in cardio and being strict on my diet probably helped more so.    This is probbaly the research article he was pimping at the time,  published in 2012 (same era as the article you posted): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3488566/

dah fuck?

I can't use the smith machine for anything, it just feel weird tension in my joints. It makes me feel like I'm always 2 pounds away from popping a joint.

I would guess you can do inverted rows on it or pull up variants.If you can push out your stomach and it looks like that...then you're fat.Was squatting heaviest weight in my life without a spot (I never find out what my 1RM is) and played some swag music through spotify. Game face on. At 3rd rep spotify started playing a stupid commercial making weird noises, I lmao-ed, broke air and failed mid way. Fuck spotify adsit'll work garantee itNot to mention, people like that have to be pretty pathetic if bringing other people down makes them feel better about themselves. I always get a boost by helping someone else or making someone else's day better. I imagine that people who do the opposite just have nothing better going on. Fuck em!No one mentioned kettlebells?( ?° ?? ?°) So you think I should ditch the weights entirely and follow the bw routine? Couldn't I incorporate some bodyweight exercises into my available equipment?

Also, how does bw make up for the missing squat and deadlift as I've read that legs are a general weakness in bw routines?Yup. You confuse them by progressively overloading them.Lost my car keys on a rest day. Went to the gym in the morning like I usually do and I'm benching today. My heads not in the game because I'm mad at myself for losing the keys and I set my form wrong. I can't lift it off of me ( going for a 5RM of 170) and I have to do the roll of shame.

I come back at night and try again and I have to roll of shame again.

Definitely the worst gym day in a while :( and I lost my car keys.This submission has been removed.

I can never tell if someone's done with a machine or simply between sets.

Yeah, it's called "asking them" and it's something most normal human beings figured out how to do when they were 5.https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2y7az6/i_have_to_have_hand_surgery_dont_want_to_lose/I didn't know they made Christmas trees in flesh colors!Ham work is KNEE FLEXION, so GHR/Nordic curls, hamstring curls.

I've been "jeans guy," "white undershirt guy," and "tube sock guy" at the gym before because I forget the relevant piece of clothing that day.  Too late, already here, gonna do my thing regardless.Before we let him go, i think you should tell us what he got locked up for. Was he the dumbell thrower! ?3 sets of 10 reps. My arms don't hurt that much during back day anymore once I learnt how to focus on lat muscles. Imagine pulling with your elbows, this will help take you arms out of the movements.

My genetics are nothing special, I'm just willing to push myself each time I enter the gym and make a conscious effort with my diet.I do go to Baylor! They've actually opened Russell's gym up, but... there's no platform, and I use it in both of my workouts. If they had one over there, I'd jump on the $50 offer to use that space.why did you know he was drunk?Your rhythm coming out of the hole in squat is off. Your hips raise before your back, using quad power before/more than ass power... WAIT ARE YOU SQUATTING IN RUNNING SHOES?HodorDon't think it's necessary to do so many bicep and tricep isolations. If I'm reading it right, on your back day you're doing somewhere around 200 reps of bicep curls, while also engaging them in pulley rows and chin-ups, etc. You're doing the same for triceps, over 200 reps of isolations while also heavily engaging them in dips, all three bench press exercises and the shoulder press.

Even with uneven arms this just seems very excessive to me.Agreed, I see almost no use for them personally. I think calf raises might be only time I would end up in one Even if they are Converse?  What difference will no shoes make?Round my way we call them Donkey BallsSquat day is every day, specifically high bar ass-to-grass squats. And make sure you deadlift 1-2 days a week. Your booty will show up in 6-12 months and only increase in size as weight increases.I was told in this sub that 225 is an accomplishment for a lot of the users here. Reading these stories i can only imagine low weight being usedThanks and thank you for the lengthy answer!
A rack is out of the question as long as I'm living in this 1-room-apartment. But I could maybe fit a barbell under the bed. The thing is, I would need to get a 30mm-barbell to put my available weight on it as well. Are they inherently inferior or not too bad for a home gym?
Let's say I can get a barbell and additional 125 lbs in weights. How long would I last with that? How long does it usually take a deadlift beginner to reach his own bodyweight?
So, there's this one older dude who for whatever magical reason comes in on the days I'm benching right around my third set when I need a spotter most. He'll spot me, I'll finish up, then he'll take the bench. Not much is said most of the time. I'll offer to spot him if he needs help, told him just wave me down whenever. 

He calls me over to make sure he gets 4 reps of 245lb. I asks if he needs help getting the bar of the rack, he says no, then proceeds to nail 4 reps pretty easily. He then ups the weight to 275. If 245 was his 4RM, then 275 wouldn't be a crazy 1RM. He doesn't ask for help getting it off the rack but says he's only going for 1 rep. He takes it off, I have my hands there, and he pretty much just lets it fall on his chest with not a lot of resistance. I react as quickly as I can to get the bar off his chest but he lets out a yelp and it's pretty much just me pulling 275 off of him. So, I get the it off him, and he's obviously in a lot of pain. He's pretty cool about the whole thing. I ask him if he's okay and he says no and just leaves the gym. Anyway, I feel bad that I wasn't directly under the bar as he was bringing it down but the dude didn't ask me to. Also feel bad because he's one of my unspoken gym bros and I could've kept him from getting hurt. Went to buy a suit today. Dude said I must workout a lot. He was probably just kissing my ass, but as a skinny guy, I'm gonna go ahead and take it.

Not really a gym story, but I had to tell someone.Thanks,  why would you put peanut butter in it?  Dosent it contain high amount of sugar and fat?  or Nutella?I am in your same exact situation. I have to sacrifice something for the sake of my health, but I already lack a social life.

I wake at 4:30 these days and run to the local park to do the 300 workout. It's a fast paced high impact resistance training that can manage 300 reps in 20 minutes. Run back home, cold shower meditate and get ready for the long work day. 

Since I am still New though there's the beginner's modified version that only does 100 reps of a full body workout, and since I am definitely out of shape still, it hasn't been easy for me to finish (although I haven't yet ????) but still go out and run!I always have a big bowl of chopped up lettuce in my fridge ready to go for the week's lunches. Same thing with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and sometimes brown rice. As far as tasty, not boring salads go, I like to alternate between these few recipes:  

* Sort of like a Nicoise salad: one can of solid white albacore tuna, drained, 1/2 tbsp Dijon mustard, 1/2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp lemon juice, a handful of black olives, thinly sliced red onion, chopped cherry tomatoes, a hard boiled egg, fresh dill, a touch of freshly cracked black pepper.  

* Sort of Mediterranean salad: 1/2 cup chickpeas, 1/4 cup feta cheese, fresh dill, fresh parsley, fresh mint, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 tsp red wine vinegar, 1 tsp Dijon mustard, 1/2 tbsp olive oil, chopped cherry tomatoes, chopped red onion, 1/2 tbsp capers, chopped olives, diced bell peppers, diced cucumber, (optional) 2 oz. cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast or fish, such as salmon.  

* Delicious fruity salad: 2 tbsp chopped nuts, 1/4 cup fresh blueberries, 3 large strawberries, sliced, 1 oz crumbled goat cheese, 1/2 tbsp honey, 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp Dijon mustard, sliced red onion, 2-4 oz boneless, skinless chicken breast.  

* Tex-Mex salad: 1/2 cup black beans, 1/4 cup sweet corn, chopped bell peppers, chopped red onion, 1 tsp hot sauce, 1/2 tbsp lime juice, 1/2 tbsp olive oil, fresh cilantro, 2 oz boneless, skinless chicken breast, sliced avocado, diced tomatoes, chopped scallions, sliced radishes.  

Warning, if you go for all of the fresh herbs and whatnot in these salads, they can be sort of pricey, but they're just as fine without all of the fancy accoutrements. I don't really have a bench but a rather short piano stool which I am currently using for dumbbell flyes. That seems Ok for now as the weight is not that heavy. Dumbbell presses would probably be a little unstable with that setup.I try to be nice since I'm a grad student that's teaching a course. I probably wouldn't get in trouble for it, but... it's really best just not to make waves if you can help it.Normally as a wrestling fan I'd chastise you for saying that but when it comes to Randy Orton....When I walk past the gym classes in the morning it just smells of sweaty pussy... Makes me heave IMO standing calf raises are a lot better on the smith machine. With a barbell sometimes you lose your balance.Something about the indignity of 2.5  though....When I squat I'll try and drive my lift through my quads and up my glutes (by squeezing), but when it gets to the glutes it feels extremely uncomfortable so I stop that to complete the lift.  I also get quite a bit of pain in my lower back, which I've read is from removing the glutes from the lift (I've also had back problems since I quit gymnastics 14 years ago).

Based on form checks that I've posted here other people have suggested that I don't use my glutes nearly enough, which would fall in line with the low back pain, and APT.Do people cross the road when you walk near them late at night?always done them either that way or with a barbell, never two dumbellsI bet you cold pick up a used rowing machine pretty cheap on Craigslist. And yeah, 20 minutes of rowing in the morning and 10 of yoga at night will whip you into shape. Or at least a better shape than you are now.How does one put back a deadlift?AGAIN....

curling in the squat rack... but its better this time...

he brought an EZ curl over to use it... could barely set it on the safety pins without it falling... then monkeying around with getting plaets on it, since it rests on where the plates goI usually go to my campus gym at around 11-12, in between classes. On this past Monday, I stopped by the front desk to ask for a towel. As I was handing over my ID card, one of the girls at the desk stopped me and said, "Hey, I work here every Monday, and I've noticed that you come in here every Monday. Keep doing whatever it is that you're doing!"

It's a nice feeling when someone notices. Ten minutes later, I still failed my bench set, but then I proceeded to annihilate my OHP. It was a good day.Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

I have a pair of flat shoes somewhere, will dig them up.
What's the correct way to get the ass power out of the hole?Weird that people even bother with cutting/bulking cycles then... /show many sets of barbell to the face brah?Don't sweat this shit man. It's always the stupid non-lifting fucks who pull this shit. 

I get the struggle man. Almost every single big guy was at one point a bullied skinny or fat fuck. People don't get so absorbed with lifting without a little tenacity, so you won't usually see the big guys making that type of nonsense unless it's a former athlete who now bodybuilds or powerlifts who was always elite athleticly. Even then, most guys who just have straight up gifts still respect heart above all else. It's just rare to see a big douche. 

I forgot how hard it was to be at noob level until recently. I've only been lifting for 8 weeks as I haven't been able to lift for 6 months because I was in an accident. I've been having to lift at my uni gym 2/x week instead of all my time at my typical little hardcore gym. My weights have been low, but I've still been going balls to the wall which has gotten some weird looks when you're face is red as the sun and your making weird noises after deadlifting 2 plates or squatting 135. But every session my gains explode exponentially and this past week I squatted above 250 again. I made sure to stare down the frat douche who laughed at me a few weeks ago after I racked... Because I went from 135-250 full ATG in the past 2 months while he's been stuck at 225 quarter squats laughing at everyone else. Next week I'll hit 275, etc etc. Then I'll pick up gear again and I'll be crushing big numbers, and people will start talking about how much progress I've made, getting the head nods of respect from other advanced lifters again. I don't doubt this. You shouldn't either! You'll get there

Keep your head down, and keep making progress and in a few months you'll be hitting bigger numbers and somewhere down the line you're going to hit 2/3/4 and these people will all give you the face of defeat because you're better than them. Always were, and always will be. It's what's inside man. Everyone who matters in the gym is going to give you the utmost respect based on how hard you're working, not your size or strength. Fuck, at my gym most people lift in hoodies or baggy shirts so you never even know what people look like, and then get into that TuT shit and weight is then irrelevant. All this shit don't matter to anyone who matters..

 Just imagine what it will feel like when you slam a 4 or 5 or fuck even 6 idk plate dead and turn around to see that bitch with a face that can only be compared to that of constipation because that day will happen and it will be glorious for you... it will be the defining moment that you made it. I've done double leg glute bridges, but it didn't seem to be working the right thing. I'll give single leg a shot, thanks.Just because I can squat a good amount doesn't mean I can't squat more with better mechanics.Happens to everyone. Especially during sit-ups. The abs are pushing up the fat on top of them. If you lose fat it'll happen less, if it's really that bothersome.&gt;I've always imagined martial arts as somethign you need to do starting at a young age (like music) 

Martial arts is for anyone of any age. It's all about the dedication and effort you put into it. I know some amazing fighters who only started training in their 30s, and some guys who have better technique and form having started at 40 than the young guys who already have 10 years under their belt thanks to starting at age 10.

I started at age 12 (15 years ago) and I will be the first to admit someone who has worked like a madman for 1-3 years at Judo or Boxing will kick my ass since I haven't been doing serious training for the past year. Dedication, consistent practice, and the right attitude are all you need. I do the same. Out the door at 5am, workout at 515, 520am, and I am done and out the door of the gym at 630-645am and at work around 730 to 8am. I work till 6,7,8pm (I am self employed so the more I get done the more I make) and then I am tired from being outside most of the day doing physical work. Volunteer at a hospital dialysis center. Whenever I make my rounds delivering jugs of bicarbonate solution to rooms, I make sure to sneak in a couple of curls.315 on your second time trying?  Seriously, why can't you buy my self-esteem some dinner before fucking it, jerk?I read that about 5 times and I still have no idea what you're trying to say. Workout before work. When you are at work, trust me I also work outside mostly and do physical work, you will find a way to get through the day no problem.How the fuck do you sleep ever?  If I have 1 cup of coffee anytime after noon, I could easily stay awake for the next 24 hours if I don't force myself to go to bed.Agreed.  Obsessive behavior in fitness/nutrition is a bad thing that can lead to worse things.[Sometimes, the heaviest things we lift are not our weights, but our feels](http://m.imgur.com/r/datfeel/Wl8pDDE).[Study on high-rep vs low-rep with equated volume](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714538/)

&gt; In conclusion, this study showed that both bodybuilding- and powerlifting-type training promote similar increases in muscular size, but powerlifting-type training is superior for enhancing maximal strength.

You can achieve great results through many different ways of training. Your problem is that you don't eat enough, not which program you're using. Pick one that looks nice in the wiki, and start eating more.To be blunt, his family is already out a parent if he's working that much.Better than flushing your sanity down the toilet.  You sound kind of obsessed on such a small issue, which in fitness/nutrition can lead to eating disorders and the like.  Let it go, it literally does not matter at all.Are you fucking dumb? The car was at a complete stop and I had the right away. He gunned it. Get the fuck out of here dude, there's no way it was my fault at all.Has anyone ever called someone out at their gym for this type of behavior? What was the interaction like? What was the result? 

I started at a new gym recently and there are a couple scumbags there that for this shit, which I'm not used to. I was on the verge of calling a guy out last week but decided against it. Okay, look. Occasionally (at my absolute best), I'm a training partner at a large MMA gym with many successful fighters. That basically means I get beat up a lot as fighters practice different moves on me, and use me as a more-interactive grappling bag. I also lift and play with my weight a lot as I move up and down weight categories.

Now onto you:

1. You're 15 years old. This means that you're still growing, and presumably in high school. You already have some of the best MMA foundation training available to you: wrestling. Do that in the winter. You're also going to be changing weight classes, and having to adapt your style as you continue to grow. If you're new, I can't suggest taking MMA until you're 18. Not to mention you won't get any fights until you're 18 (or even 21 at some places) anyways.

2. Work on the fundamentals building blocks of MMA: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Submission Wrestling. Standing Wrestling. Catch Wrestling. Boxing. Kick-boxing. Muay Thai. Chute Boxing. There's no need to jump straight into MMA training. There's a lot of technical skill you have to develop before you can even start sparring.

3. To gain weight, you need to gain MUSCLE weight. Gaining fat is not a good idea because it slows you down, and puts you in heavier weight classes against guys much bigger and stronger than you. To gain muscle weight, you need to pick up a weight-lifting routine, eat 500cals over your TDEE, and don't slack from the program you commit to.

4. This is not a hobby, this is a lifestyle. You as a 15 year old have no idea what long-term commitment is, but I'll try to convey this as best I can. If you think counting calories is tough, then you're not cut out for MMA. If you can't even *write down* what you're eating and look up the calories, then there's no way you have the mentality to take a beating (both to your body and your ego), and still come back the next day with respect to how you got beat. This sort of training is part of what separates the boys from the men. Men come into the gym every day without question. THAT IS LIFE FOR THEM. Boys come in and get upset when they get beat, and leave. Mental fortitude is the toughest thing about training, and so far, you haven't exhibited it.

So I've given you the information you need here to succeed, but I don't think you will. I'll happily fly out to your first amateur MMA fight, or even train with you at fight camp, but first you have to prove me wrong. Get 3 years of consistent training in the above that I've listed, and I'll be there to help you. But I won't have to, because I've seen your type before, and they never stick around.

Now go prove me wrong.I'd swap out the stairs and hill climbs for goblet squats and deadlifts with your EZ curl bar, 120lb isn't that bad and I'm a bit leery about stairs for hypertrophy. Maybe step ups using dumbbells if you have firm enough furniture of the right height. Other options could be bulgarian split squats, single leg squat, or pistol squats,, if you're stable enough.Oh alright thanksNo, extreme conditions like arctic temperaturesWas it because he curled in the squat rack?Agreed. Certainly best to clear this with a doctor before attempting anything beyond lifting a glass of water.having tons of people in an area makes it seem that you can do something and get away with it, like littering. but if there are a very small amount of people you see all the time like in small gyms you behave better.  My gym is big but the messy people area always the people around 5-7pm.I had a similar problem. And wasn't getting decent numbers at all for my weight and size. I was wearing running shoes. Converse should make no difference between with and without. But it can't hurt. or from rolling an 18 wis during character creation
On the other hand, I'll have a Red Bull and pass out.I added 40lbs to my deadlift after changing my style up and doing it just like he shows. My wife added 20lbs to hers in one trip to the gym. I personally like it a lot and use his way exclusively. You won't have to. OP didn't even read the article they linked.

&gt; But don’t get too hung up on analyzing all the nutrient interactions. “I think you can obsess too much over how you combine nutrients,” says Dickinson. “Some people schedule their intake of different foods at precise times throughout the day to avoid any conflicts, and that’s definitely taking it too far.”

No , 35 F&gt;  standing at the urinals in bare feet while taking a piss. (every day)

bare feet in the locker room is just gross in general, but around toilets/urinals is a million times worse.Hey man, progress is relative. No one got to benching 315 without starting somewhere first. Only thing you can do is continue to improve and be better than your previous self. Best of luck man. Except it fucking is in the context of this conversation.The bwf FAQ talks about incorporating weights with bwf training: http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_i_usually_train_with_barbells.2Fdumbbells.2C_how_do_i_integrate_that_with_bodyweight_training.3F

For legs they recommend barbell squats if you have access to the equipment and provide alternatives if you don't. Eg pistol squats and lunges once you progress beyond bodyweight squats There's nothing about whey protein that's going to give you more of a chance to build muscle on a cut vs any other decent protein source (except maybe the lucine/isolucine content but that's majoring in the minors). If you have a large amount of fat to lose or in puberty then you have a chance to build muscle while losing fat. Just lift heavy, eat a reasonable deficit, and see what happens. Happened just now. 

I finished squatting and, as I always do, I rearranged all the plates so they same ones were stacked together (it amazes me how people can't seem to do this on their own).

A guy asked if I was done, I said yeah, and then I said, "check out these plates, look at how pretty they are. This is my art. Don't mess it up!" He laughed. Moment shared.

It's been about ten minutes. I just looked and the plates are all fucked up and out of order again. Oh well.Just from my experience with PPL:

Weighted chinups/pullups (~2 plate, at least) were brutal on my biceps even with just 3x5. It was impacting my pushing 2 days later (biceps are stabilizers for many push excercises) so I had to drop the weighted part or rest an extra day. YMMV depending on how heavy you are going.thats not accurate? a table spoon of pb has 4 g'syea, but if he keeps on like this he might kill himself.No, I don't believe that anyone needs bcaa if they get needed amino acids from food throughout the day/week/month Thanks for the input. I've now read that uphill running is better as HIIT and overall fitness than to grow muscle. You just confirmed it.

The thing is, I am already at 12-15 reps doing deadlifts with my EZ curl bar. I could get more weights but there will soon be another limit because of the short mounting space.are you seriously asking and contemplating living off of solely protein cookie dought just because it has a 40/40/20 split? that's fucking ridiculous, your body is far more complex than that and needs real food. Multivitamins are not real food, and neither is cookie dough. Yes, you can survive, and probably put on muslce, but you are going to feel and look like shit, probably have digestion problems, and will absolutely hate that diet within days.Have you tried carrots and peanut butter? Way better than celery&gt;What's the correct way to get the ass power out of the hole?

Idk, tbh. Could be a disproportionate strength issue or simply a control issue. Do you do goblet squats and ab vacuums?PB2 Fuck all the tiny little specific things that people do.  Do what YOU want to do, and start small.  Everything doesn't have to be perfect at the start.  The yoga studio app on the iPhone is amazing. Beginner thru advanced "classes" (videos) also divided up by time - 15, 30, 60 mins1 week is not a good time frame to judge it.. give it a few weeks I would say. But, yes, if you stay the same it's safe to say you're eating at maintenance.Thanks man, i will be watching youtube videos to ensure I get better form. My new gym offers a free hour with a personal trainer, so I took it.  Trainer told me I looked "carb sensitive" which I realized is the fitness way to say "you look fat".  :(Yeah it tastes kind of sweet. I drank it from a 27 year old pregnant womans titties. Also I can't see why it's that laughable to think that. It's probably really fucking good for you. I feel really conscious about my warm ups too, load up a little bit and do the reps nice and slow, stretch off a bit and then get into the proper sets. I don't have too much fat to lose and I'm a late teen. I understand that it's not the Whey in itself that's going to change anything, it's just that I assumed that running on a deficit while still maintaining high protein intake would allow me to make muscle gains while on a cut. Whey protein is just a way for me to increase my protein intake while maintaining a caloric deficit.Heavy lunges.I'm not in that great of shape, so I'm still on that same level as you probably. What I do is breathe in for four steps then breathe out for four steps for as long as I can, then I lower to breathe in for three steps breathe out for three and just alternateI can't go to the gym for 5 more days because I just had surgery. I'm living vicariously through all of you.Benching next to a guy whose odoriferous swamp ass wafted over to me and made me drop the dumbbells on my chestYeah, the general advice would be to take it easy until your doctor has a good idea of exactly what's going on.  Your cardiologist is there to help you and will happily answer every question you could have for them.  I personally had Wolff-parkinson-white, got a few ablations and I've been fine ever since.  Don't worry about it, just be specific with your questions about how hard you can push yourself.  Best of luck!  Eat your proteins and prepare to be surprised that your lifts haven't fallen a bit after the break.

In fact sometimes shorter breaks can even be helpful, but 3 weeks is not gonna be harmful either. RelaxExercise is one of the best things you can do to combat the heart break of a break up. So I don't follow there.

I would try to practice meditation before or after your work out as it's scientific proven to reduce stress.im doing something very similar to ice cream and starting strength. people get mad if you go off routine so i dont mention it.

i remember when i started, doing bench would tap my triceps out for the day nearly. especially if i went with incline too (i like to do both). I just follow the altered routine and then work what i can isolated to near exhaustion. 3 sets of 8 or 10 on most. biceps were obviously something i worked isolated from the start. tris too. shrugs. ohp. rows. calf lifts (my best lift because i used to be 300+ for nearly 10 years).

i started with cardio just because i was so fat and i got sore so easily. now i skip it (because i hate cardio a lot unless im actually playing a sport or...moving with a reason, like drums) and i just work my ass off moving weight. im out of breath enough to feel like im working out in a cardiovascular way. for instance, doing squats/leg press completely destroys me for 10 minutes at least. maybe my breathing isn't very good, but ive been consciously working on it.

i just listen to my body. once i was doing around 155 on bench 5x5. id try to squeeze in another 3x5 at 135 on incline. or close to it, maybe the last set would go to 3 lifts or something. curl the barbell until you cant, and then do another one or two. 

for me a big thing was my exhaustion point for a lot of muscles kept increasing so i felt like i should work them in different ways. so doing the compound movements alone was great to start, but then i felt like i need more.

note: im not a pro or anything even close, just a fat dude who did a little research and a lot of work.Well I mean, I the muscle definitely cramped when I landed and it took a while to stretch it. Is it really possible its anything other than a cramp?Wow, 40 yrs, that's impressive! Somehow I missed your comment the first time around. You're the only one here that's actually had the experience doing it so that's very valuable to everyone here, not just me.

I'm in my late thirties and I can already see that when I push myself hard in the weight room, something or the other pops up - knee pain, tendonitis in the arm, hamstring tightness. I'm beginning to focus more on flexibility, stretching, foam rolling. 

I don't want to have to give up a good thing just because I was purely chasing numbers, instead of sustainability. So your example of body weight fitness is very appealing; I make sure to do BW stuff in my routine even now (chinups, dips, decline pushups) but I guess I need to transition more to it.

With you on the diet part. Been eating that way now for a little while and I've lost the craving for junk foods. If there is no fiber and lean protein, I don' even feel like eating it.no way man, not excuses at all. As a guy that gets 60+ hours a week I understand a little, working a 12 isn't fun or inspiring at the end of the day. Don't let this part time douche tell you anythingWhat are your lifts at currently, how much do you weight and how tall are you?I'm pretty sure that's the official way to start a gym duel.They're wrong. In fact everyone with long femurs even has to push their knees past the toes when squatting.You are really over thinking thisI am 35, my cardio HR shoots up to 170, my resting rate is rarely above 60. Now, you should have talked to your doctor about this, but your HR probably has more to do with the state of you CV system than with your ADHD.This guy was benching 3 plates and change. There was about 3 or 4 guys, myself included, that stopped our workouts and watched this guy bang off 7 reps silky smooth without even a grunt. 

I witnessed this woman using the rope cable pull down. Tricep extensions you say? Nope. She was jumping in the air putting the rope behind her head and landing on one knee into a crunch. 

I go to our local Y and this week they had photographers in to take photos to update brochures, website, etc. the manager came over to me and asked if I would mind if the photographers could take some pictures of me during my workout. I said sure and was just hoping I didn't smash a dumbbell or barbell off my face and they catch it on camera. 

On your pull b day, I would suggest switching the light deadlifts with barbell rows. 3-4 sets of 8 should be good, this will help your shoulders from becoming unbalanced from your push days and strengthen your upper back further.I do goblet squats, but I have some anterior pelvic tilt so there is definitely a strength imbalance.Painful popping or snapping is bad sign in the shoulder as it indicates shoulder instability.  Whats causing that, no one here can tell you, you need to see a Ortho.  If it goes away with rest and does not recur, you are fine.  But if it does not, or if it continues to recur with activity, you would be well advised to speak to a professional, non-redditor, about it. 

General advice: warm up your Rotator Cuff with resistance bands before shoulder work (any pushing really) and incorporate RC strengthening into your program.  I don't know if you've hurt yourself with this pain but this advice is good anyway.  I wish I had done it before my shoulder injuries. Sounds really cool. I'd love top try that out.Just keep protein intake high 1.5g/lb body weight and lift at a high intensity. Those fuckers! http://i.imgur.com/V7tbZ0A.jpg

Say I've already hit my big three for the day, but I still want to rep out some OHP, calf rasies, or shrugs. Smith machine works just fine for this. 

Yeah OHP in the Smith machine will get some flak, but I've already benched, squatted, and did rows. Often 5rep or 3 rep maxes.

It might not be a sport like football but it is like a sport. By exercising you're risking injury (pretty minimal risk though) just like every sport. That was my point. 

Although that's not a reason to not workout. The benefits absolutely outweigh the risks. Man I don't even use that machine and if I walked in and saw that I would think you were the biggest dick in the gym until I saw the sign. Then I would think it was hilarious. Well done. 

The gym at my school also had a sign clearly saying it was broken and a ton of people tried to use it anyway. I felt bad for the staff who had to tell at least 6 people to stop using it.

Some serious fat logic there fattie.So yesterday i was squatting to see what my max was. Ended up being 2 plates. There was a "personal trainer" there who always gives me and a couple of friends half assed advice. Anyways after i did my max he shook his head. I didn't notice but my friend did and he told me about. 

My problem is that THIS DUDE WAS DOING 2 PLATE SQUATS IN THE FUCKING SMITH MACHINE. How dare anyone do 3/4th squats in the fucking smith machine than criticize others doing shit by free weights? Holy fuck. 

Smith machines are great for people with injuries or other limitations. I have hypermobility in my shoulder and have to use the smith machine to bench press or my shoulder pops out.How's squash? Do you play often? Just wondering because I never see anyone else that does here.There is this idea that body weight is some how better or safer than using free weights, but I have not found any evidence to support the idea. Its all about the volume, intensity, and how willing you are to push yourself to extreme levels of performance.

Regarding martial arts, you can start at any age. Injury potential can be pretty high at a competitive level. At a less competitive level, it depends a lot on what you are training and the training environment (i.e. train with hyper-agressive jerks and you are going to get hurt).dumbbells at my PF go up to 75 pounds 
Dude, I took a beating 35 times already. Training kickboxing for 3 years and taekwondo 6 years. You come here and say that I don't have a mentality for a sport based on a notebook and food?

Thanks for the help anyways... but this really isn't ok.Its the anniversary of not going to the gym in a month :DIgnore him, and keep on doing what you do man.These guys who say "squat" are just repeating shit they read online.

You ever see MMA guys and how they all have Black Ass?

Air squats, Hindu squat, Duck walks etc.

You want ass? Join a boxing gym, Judo gym or wrestling gym...In 2 mths. you'll have ass.

Show me one Greco guy who doesn't have a nice ass. &gt;So, would you recommend I keep doing these exercises at 8-12 reps with increased weight every week or would a split of some sort work better for me?

Does that mean that you have no split at all, and you're just doing everything except for cardio all in one day?

Btw, I love your program, using creativity with limited resources is always respectable. I'd cut out the upright rows though,  because [reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SnVJDt7jts) and the front raises seem a bit redundant with military press.should I do third world squats? or is that the kind of "stretching" that should be avoided?

I have a PhD I don't want and you have a job, so you most definitely aren't me.  What's your squat?  When I started doing microcycles, my long-unimproved bench finally slowly started to grow.  Would highly recommend.well this guy is the classic shit tier trainer. you'll notice he never gives time for the person to respond to anything hes saying. its a strategy to stop them from disagreeing with him.

this guy gives off a crazy chester vibe to me and also hes very out of shape. he reminds me of that crazy old guy at the gym who knows everything about working out and really wants to tell you about what you're doing wrong.I always feel most people see me when I'm warming up on the bar and no one is around when I hit my max.I instagrammed a picture just like this this past week and there was an outcry of rage in my comments. 

In golf there's a rule for divots. Fix yours plus one. If enough people follow it, it keeps the course better for everyone. I apply that rule to the gym. Rerack my weights plus one or two; throw away my paper towel plus another I see on the floor. The general wisdom about not gaining muscle on a cut *already* assumes you're eating enough protein. Whey doesn't have magical anabolic powers, and is not meaningfully better or worse than protein from food.Stupid question real quick if a workout says 

3x5 do you keep the weight the same all 3 reps?

Also 10-12 means you aim for 10 but if you can do 12 do it and if your doing 12 every set increase the weight further correct?Goddamn that gets my back up. Wouldn't matter if that was your working weight, you're as entitled to use the kit. You're a better man than me for not tearing them both a new arsehole.As I understand it, the reason for less sets of deadlifts is three-fold

1. When the weight gets heavy, deadlifts are an exhausting exercise. It takes a lot out of you.

2. The squats that you're doing every day (if you're doing them right) target some of the same muscle groups as deadlifts.  The goal of the program is just to get those muscles stronger, which theoretically should happen, and adding more deadlifts won't necessarily accelerate that growth.

3. Form breaks down when people get tired. Happens to everyone.  When you're cranking out that 4th and 5th rep, on the 4th and 5th set, it doesn't look perfect.  That's completely ok. We're humans.  However, deadlifting heavy at a level where your form starts to break down is somewhat riskier than a lot of other movements. If you can't keep form with a bench press, the weight comes back down and your spotter can help you out. When your form starts to go while deadlifting, your back starts to round and you're risking damage to a disc that can follow you for months, if not years. (This one is the lesser of the three concerns, but it is a concern)

Disclaimer: that's just how it was explained to me and I very well could be wrong.  I welcome constructive critique and errors in this. I'm here to learn, as well.About three shitty Depending on what cable machine you've got at disposistion you could add standing chest press, it would be closest thing to bench press. You could throw in flys to if the handles can be placed around your forearm above the wrist.

For squats you could try high bar, zercher or front squats with arms crossed over. 

Shoulders... Neutral grip dumbbell presses come to mind. That being said neutral grip could be used for DB bench pressing too.How are your knees, cardio wise?

I think I either have runner's knee or crepitus but an concerned I'm going to break themOnce the weight starts adding up then come back and ask if it's enough haha. Plus once the weight increases you'll have your warmup sets. For now practice on your form, breathing, grip, etc...Nope. A YMCA in the UK. Dude you got to finish the set.Wow, this helped a lot, thanks.Or join a boxing gym and get that ass in 2 mths.

GSP has a huge black ass and he doesn't even train with weights. I have a huge muscular ass and 90% is attributed to MMA. I don't squat period. ...or dead lift. Nutrition is one of the most important components of weight loss. What and how much are you normally and currently eating? If you are drinking soda, and eating processed foods, I would definitely recommend to eat and drink less of it. And work your way to eliminating your intake of that almost completely. During my fitness journey, I ate a lot of chicken, salmon, salads, quinoa, brown rice, oatmeal. And it was all delicious! Once your body adapts to a healthier lifestyle, you begin to stop craving less healthy foods. But you should still treat yourself once in a while (: I would exercise 5 days a week, and allow your body 2 rest days. So that your body is able to recuperate. I would rotate cardio and strength. Because you wouldn't want to only do cardio. Because doing solely cardio could cause you to lose muscle. Best if luck to you!!Read closer.ouch!I do actually pull sumo myself.  Just do conventional training and trap bar for balancing out.Fuck those twats. You're doing it. Keep at it, dude. FAQ section. Controlling your calorie intake is priority #1 for losing weight.single leg glute bridgesOnly when adding weight or needing calories.  Otherwise yes I have used nutella also.Yeah probably. Careful with that, it can be really tough on the elbows. I would personally avoid it and just fail the rep in most cases instead of going one arm than the other. Are you celebrating that it's gonna be 1 year without going to the gym?My gym is very proud of its extremely courteous clientele. Everyone in the gym is so nice that they always leave a plate or 3 on the barbell for the next person to use it!   Will go for 1 more week then. I lost 1lb the first week of eating at 4.2kcals and this is the second week. I'm assuming my first pound or so was water weight.Pretty sure I already have body dysmorphia, and any critique I got would stick in my head and I'd hate myself for it I had it  at the Olympia expo, interesting consistency but it tasted pretty good. yikes, why would they make those?Saw a really old couple between their late 70s through 80s. Anyways, they were moving really slowly but they were trying. The thing that got to me was how caring they were for each other. I have to say it was heart warming and I am a dude. They helped each other on the weight machines, patted each other on the back and gave essentionally supported each other. It was fuckibg beautiful!I don't know how I'd feel if they mistake me for a man.What, no. 0.8g/lb would completely suffice.I go to porkys gym, it's a gym in south Florida where mostly people who go to actually work out and not just check out girls or talk and waste time, last week they got bought out by you fit and pretty much went from 5 flat bench to 1 and everyone with memberships to porkys get screwed over Your not going low enough... break parallel and then back up. Also, lower the safety bars, so you have enough room. Looks like you head position is incorrect as your looking straight / slightly upwards, should be looking 5-7' on the floor. Focus on proper breathing as this will make a huge difference. 

Watch the Rippeoe video over at Art of Maniless, very helpful... best of luck!Yea those bottom three sources you cited don't actually say lack of strength is a MAIN factor. It's just one of the factors of many. If anything, 4+ meds seem to be the biggest culprit.that's a fabulous OHP, has to be my slowest progression on any liftThis submission has been removed.

Anything you can do on a smith machine you can do with a barbell, only better. swolematesThis is a super minor thing, but it makes me happy. I work out one-to-one with a coach, and my workout often overlaps with a beginner class. They're usually done before I am, and they leave the place a fucking mess.  I've been cleaning up their stuff sometimes after I clean up my equipment, because my coach and I are usually the last ones out. I never expected anyone else to notice or care, I just do it because I appreciate being able to work out there. The gym owner came up to my coach Wednesday night and told him that he was really impressed by how hard I bust my ass during workouts and that he really appreciated me being around and doing everything I do. It means even more to me because the gym owner makes no money off of me, since I'm a private client rather than a gym member. Yay for being appreciated! Thanks! Will do. Heat is the act of the transfer. Hot is the presence of thermal energy. Cold is the lack of thermal energy. Cool is what happens to the object losing it's energy in a heat transfer.

Heat and cold are different. Hot and Cold are (subjective) measures of the same scale. Heat and Cool are straight up opposites.Every one is different.I see guys get completely jacked on very high rep workouts while other do well on low rep/high lbs.. It's different for everyone and don't make anyone convince you other wise.

If your goal is muscle mass and not strength you have to experiment.

I understand that it's not the whey in itself that's going to change anything, I've probably just poorly phrased my question. I mean to ask if having a high protein intake while on a caloric deficit will result in muscle gains or not. Whey is just an aid to my goal for high protein intake. &gt; Then I nearly tore my ankle in half on Thursday playing basketball. Doctor says I'll be off physical activity for 4-6 weeks and will probably be limping for at least 2.

Funny. I didn't hear anything being wrong with your chest, bis, tris, shoulders, or back... Why you being so lazy?

Just kidding. Make sure you're healed before you get back in there. You can do some upper body once you're almost healed. Stretch your legs daily and keep your protein intake adequate to prevent muscle loss. Focus on fitness videos, nutrition videos, or basketball technique to keep your mind in the game. Last summer I split open my knee and was out for 1.5 weeks (not nearly as long as you). I watched fitness and nutrition videos every day, and it kept me in the game mentally. Found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwXqkyrsrP4) in related vids; not disappointedCareful with those free hours. I know a personal trainer, and he told me how it's common place to use the free hour to "shame you" and purposely not give you any info that will help you work on your own.

As he explained it: "Well, the first time I gave one of these free hours I wrote a full body workout for this guy and taught him proper form for the exercises. He never booked again, and just did the circuit I had designed for him. Since then, I only give really small tips and say things like `we'll work on that next time`. Also, when you see the potential client doesn't like something about themselves, you comment about it to ensure him it's noticeable and then make clear that you can help them get rid of it."

It really helps him get customers, although it's (I see it as) a huge dick move.Don't have to patronize me, bro. I know how thermodynamics work. I was just curious how he drank it.My knees sound like a creaky door, but the real problem is my ankles and feet, specifically the peroneal and posterior tibial tendons. They hurt like hell after a bit of running so I do other low-impact cardio, though to be honest, I'm lazier than i should be. 90 minutes per week is all I can stand haha. I'm in the gym now trying to get my leg game on but some bro and his girlfriend have spent the last hour going back and forth doing every Olympic lift out there in the only squat rack. Fucking livid. All I wanna do is squat. 

They eve done deadlifts, cleans, front squats, over head press since I've been hereDo you go to the southwest Louisville location? Because this sounds exactly like what I see there every Sunday Doing those with the Smith sounds like a sweet way to fuck up your lower back.Heating (or cooling) is the act of transfering heat (thermal energy).

XD, we are arguing semantics.Stop tracking all the numbers that you normally pay attention to while working out.  Just hit the gym, lift some weights, run a few laps, get a good sweat going and be done.  It might not be the most optimum workout, but it will be stress free and you will feel a lot better once you are done.  After life settles down a bit, go back to a more structured plan.Wtf I can't bench 45 kgsNot even a snake to see.You gotta hit the toilet after taking the PWO and before lifting, man.What do you weigh and are you male or female?

I'm sorry but if you're an average sized male lifting for a year and a half seriously those numbers are low. I don't mean this to be discouraging, but you should really get on a good program. 

What's your routine like right now? Have you ever ran a beginner routine? Yea, most guys don't like cooking. It probably has more to do with cleaning up afterwards though. Nobody likes cleaning up. 

Good job mate, keep it up!I agreeNo smith, free weights&gt;osteoarthritis



&gt;your stabalisers need work

u wot m8?Went yesterday for my 2nd chest/arms workout of the week. I go to World Gym in the la area. Been going there for 6 years but lifting for 3. I was able to renew my membership for super cheap ($170 for 28 months). Unfortunately, I drank last night at brofallo wild wings watching hockey so I had a feeling my workout was going to be weak. However I was able to hit a pr. benched 335 for 3 reps. Not really a big deal at my gym a lot of people compete and easily do 405 no spot. I was there for 3 hours and it never got crowded. I have a theory that everybody gets motivated to go to gym on Monday then maybe they'll go Wednesday but by Friday all motivation is gone. In 6 years I've never seen the gym packed Friday-Sunday. Impressive/surprising things I saw... A guy squatting 375 raw no spot, a guy who was about 140 lbs deadlifting 315, a girl with huge calves, somebody wearing a Wayne gretzky tank top (early 90s kings shield with "the great one" inside) this guy who's like 5'7 but looks like he competes deadlifting 5 plates and change. As for me I had a good workout I benched, did machine and cable flys, dumbbell press, body weight dips, tricep extension (machine and cable) triceps pushdowns, some forearms. I did other stuff but I honestly don't know the technical names.  it would be cool if I could film my workout and put it on YouTube without looking like a douche at the gym. I've been working towards a natural glute ham raise by setting the bar as low as possible and putting a mat underneath my kneesNext time just take your equipment, walk right over, stand in the middle of his session and drop your equipment there. Then tell him that's how it feels when a trainer leaves his equipment everywhere. Hang in there man. 

I caught mono during finals week, before winter break. Shit's real tough.

Luckily for me, the mono symptoms faded fast and I was only out of the gym for 5-6 weeks. Just give yourself plenty of rest. Hopefully your recovery is speedy.That's really inappropriate especially from the staff member, I'm sorry this happened to you. I agree with the other commenters saying you should mention it to the manager, she might have done something similar before and this could be what they need to get rid of her. Either way she will get some form of punishment if you bring it up.I went to a different gym building this past Wednesday, same company but in the next town over this time. 

Their building is bigger than my usual. Like 5x bigger. It has a pool, a basketball court, a climbing wall, and over 50 cardio machines. My regular had none of the above, with 20 cardio machines total. (They both have racquetball though :) )

Now for the travesty: the weight room. Everyone who goes to my small regular gym is nice. They (mostly) put their weights back. They will spot if you ask. They're cool guys. 

The other facility? Ugh. Wow. I saw a lot of characters I didn't think existed. 

Looking around, I saw the generic groups of guys, half repping as they do, talking more than lifting, etc. But there was one guy who really stood out. 


This guy was about 5'5" and 270lbs of solid muscle. He was a freaking honey badger of death. No respect for anyone around him, he acted like the entire weight room was for him specifically, and anyone else was trespassing. 

I was deadlifting, nothing crazy (205lbs) but still a PR. I needed clips, I saw a bench with nobody around for 5-10 mins, so I took the clips. 

That was a huge mistake. 

Mr honey badger walked on over as soon as I the weight down (quietly and respectfully, as I do) and started his intimidation tactics. In a vaguely gruff voice, he said, "did you take clips from that bench." in a flat tone. Keep in mind, nobody was on the bench for 5-10 mins and then I did all my deadlifts, another 5-10. Me: "Yeah." Him: "well I was using them." *starts to take clips.* Me: "oh, well I am done so you can have them." 

He takes them and walks the 8 feet to the bench, and proceeds to bench 4 plates. Im glad he didn't get more angry.

http://imgur.com/gallery/XDFKeVnSounds great! I need to pick a route and try it out, thank youIf you do regular cardio, your resting heart rate will decrease. 120 is not high for somebody doing physical activity.  The feeling of your heart exploding out of your chest is probably just the feeling of being very out of shape (if you are).  Cardio can feel *really* hard if you haven't done it in awhile, that mostly normal.  But - of course, if you are concerned you should check with your dr.  Worst feeling ever Get a new job.You had an extremely explosive pull and weren't in full control of the bar. It happens sometimes.YeahLunges are your best friend. Barbell with a good weight, 3x10 or 10-8-6-4-2. It's a solid compound lift I find nobody really does. I used to flare my elbows out exactly like that too when the weight got too heavy. The problem is that you're simply not [retracting your scapula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ5iCcKzg2Q) and [engaging your lats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ily2X9LCEfg). If you focus on those two cues, it'll be impossible to flare your elbows out without losing tightness in your back and your form going to shit. Might have to deload the weight a bit at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll easily lift more than your previous max.Is the old person nudity a generational thing or something we'll all be doing when we hit 70?Doing Deadlifts, threw up on four rep. Powered through and got the fifth.Cheers! I use indoor soccer shoes. They have flat sole without padding, and the rubber does not stain the floor. As they are for the indoors, there are no spikes or anything like that. Perfect lifting shoe. In fact, quite a few people in my gym do this. The only thing they are not shiny.  That's a lot of hours for a standard work week.  AbsolutelyTeach you to  make out with nasty hoes bro.  

Currently undergoing the flu cut.  6 pack in 7 days.Compliment is something pleasant said about you

Complement is something that contributes to and improves something else.

Yeah I need to do something, thanksI often do that too.  It really sucks, but it's paying pretty well.   Anything over 60 starts to put me into zombie mode.

At least for me it only lasts a few months at a time. Thanks man I appreciate it alot I think i'm gonna stick to it but just out of curiosity.

It says 5 sets and 15 total reps so your doing 3 reps per set? 

Also how do you track progression yourself
That's messed up! Nobody should ever do that. Sometimes I get a little self-conscious because I don't lift anywhere near what I should, and now I'm lifting light because caloric deficit = weak as a kitten, and also way too much body fat. So I worry people are judging me and I'm sure it would crush me if they did.  

But so far nobody has ever laughed or made a comment, because most people at the gym aren't human garbage like these women are.  

I bet they talk during movies.I'm doing 5/3/1. I swear the gym always gets significantly busier when I'm struggling through my last couple of sets at 50% 1RM, rather than when I was doing my heaviest reps.With an anal clause for lifting on a rest dayAt first I thought you meant his muscles got locked up. Then it made sense. Oh geez I feel you on the bike thing. One time I was out for a fun and some lady drove by on the road beside me and shouted "do you think this makes you better than me?!!!" (or something similar) out her window and all I could think was "lol maybe tho." They're the ones who sound dumb for standing and chatting. If I was you'd I would have just grabbed it and did my set. Learn how to google.I imagine that scene from *Lights Out* where that retired boxer with the mental issues wings that plate at the trainer. Mackerel in chili sauce and salad.It's been a recurring problem that has always gone away with rest (so far). i will try incorporating some more warm ups in. I think my form is bad. I will see how it goes. Thanks for the adviceI'm surprised to see you here Khalifa! I was see you constantly posting in bodybuilding I didn't think you would be posting here. On those daily discussions I've only seen some month to month progress, so seeing all of this is impressive. Your progress is a great example of how people CAN do splits instead of strength programs first.  I think you are well rounded and you should just keep doing what you do man. Stay positive. Well you are still quite in novice area with your lifts so no worry at all.You'll be fine once you adjust.  I often work as much as you do. Going first thing in the morning is really the only way to get it in.  Otherwise I'm just too wiped out after I get off.3 scoops of preworkoutAm I female?  I've... never met a woman who could bench 245.  I'm male.  175.  31.  I ran Jim Stoppani's Shortcut to Size a few times.  What program would you suggest?I can't stop laughing...Instant boner... no, but I have some other zero calorie substances you may be interested inBobo, bobobobo. Bobo.Post a video of your squat. Don't just assume it's going to go away by itself, it might be related to your squatting technique. Is it a sharp pain or a more of a muscle ache?

I used to get hip flexor pain when I went too deep in my squat, bouncing off my calves, which deemphasized the involvement of the posterior chain.Do you have a source for why push:pull should be 1:2? I've seen people say that a couple times on /r/fitness and while I don't disagree I'd like to see a proper source for it if possible.

Also, should lateral raises really count towards push volume in that calculation? My understanding was that they work the medial deltoid which tends to get underworked in general regardless of how many push exercises you're doing.are you a world class body builder who has every single nutrient that enters and leaves their body planned and timed, and even a small reduction in protein absorption would cause a catastrophic loss in ability? fuck no you aren't, so just drink your goddamn coffeedo it, there's no harm if she says no. i got lucky the first time, it happens. McGibs got balls too, McGibs just need feel them to know they there.

edit: just to be clear, don't fondle your testicles anywhere near her. i don't think that's a great way of showing interest.The crazy part here too is that a huge majority of the diets posted here are startlingly bad, and only focused on muscle growth. It seems like nearly every other aspect of nutrition and health falls to the wayside of muscle synthesisStop spewing what bullshit?  Are you suggesting I could get bulky biceps by curling light weight, a bunch of times? 

If I wanted a big chest I'd simply do lots and lots, and lots of flys with the little dumbbell? Hmm, see if this helps: [Mark Rippetoe: Fixing the Squat: Hip Drive ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yha2XAc2qu8). Looks like exactly your issue, except your stance looks wide enough. You also don't tuck your chin in like the guy in that video.That sounds heavenlyThird world squats are a different beast all together. Are they beneficial? Absolutely. Do I think they're the best way to go about reducing APT? Nooooot really. stock pile those dishes! LOL

Tell me about it, my new tiny apartment is a BIIITCH. I have to rip through cleaning.

Try one pot dishes. Like chilli's and stews. cuts down on cleaning, you can have a man meal  in each heaping serving too. Or omletes and shit.

or just get drunk as you cook like i do. makes everyhting more fun even the cleaning if you do it as you goDon't be a bitch about it either, Just nut up and lick your wounds.What? The OP was actually pretty tame/non arrogant in his post. All he said is that this sub circle jerks APT, which it does. I googled it and what I looked for came up! What the fuck do **you** call it?!If your PhD is in anything analytical I'll trade skill sets in a heartbeat. You can have my boring data analyst job at my tech-illiterate company. 

Squats at 315, 3x5. 

Deads at 315, 3x5.
 
Bench at 185, 3x5. Do you honestly believe that squatting a does not require a great deal of balance and focus (mental acuity)? Without a great deal of both you will fall forward and injure yourself.  I've trained in yoga for over 10 years.  So I'm not a biased lifter. Squatting has challenged both for me in a way that no yoga pose has ever. 

You're right though,  some people don't have the flexibility to squat properly,  but that doesn't mean they shouldn't in conjunction with a good stretch routine,  which can include yoga as well. Chair pose is a good way to start. I'm sure he gives some great advice, but the couple of videos I've seen him in he totally gives off this know-it-all vibe, and is waaaay too dogmatic about his approach. Ex: his skull crusher video where he says you *need* to use a barbell instead of a cable machine, but can't really explain why outside of the ability to micro-load the weight - which he concedes you can do on the cable machine. Then there's his video on why Olympic lifters should not perform the high bar squat where he just insufferable acts like he has all the answers to training because of 'geometry'. I think it's a matter of running out of fucks to give as you get older.When people are new to running they almost always try to run too hard and too fast. You need to slow down to the point where you're able to have a conversation with someone. It may feel too slow, but for the first few weeks that's the point.Snort laughed at work, thank you.Gotcha. I didn't know those were two different words lol. I feel dumb.Last night this strong looking guy was on one of our 2 squat racks and he loaded 315 lbs to the bar only to quarter rep them. I didn't say anything to him cause I can't even carry that much. But then he goes down to 135 and does the same thing. He could have easily went all the way down. I was so confused. I probably stared for way too longAaaaaand we go to the same gym. I see some weird shit at my gym. That included just today:

-a guy sitting on a exercise ball to do his curls then lying back and continuing to do curls

-somebody doing crunches and bench press supersetted while staying on the bench. oh and he kept his feet almost vertical during the benchpress. And he was lying on it the wrong way.

But most people put their weight back after they use it.Pretend you're a truck driver.  CONK CONK! But in MMA training you do a lot of bodyweight training. It's the same reason soccer goalies have big booty as well from spending time in the ready/ half squat position and diving all over the place.Risky Google Image Search of the day, too.That used to be my life before the gym. I would have killed to be able to just sit there and watch TV/ play games. But now, I actually feel sorry for you. 

May the healing god broki be with youThe first guy probably thought you werevmaking fun of him since you dl in the upper average weight rangehttp://www.imgur.com/TYpqCXA.jpeg

It was my leg day. He did about 5 sets.I just walk up to those people and look at them like theyre retarded. They usually stop so i can get my weights...then they go back to being retarded. 

Like they get that theyre in the way...they move so people can get weights...THEN THEY WALK BACK TO GET IN THE WAY 

i swear to god i think a large percentage of the human population is straight up autistic[Thanks for the nightmares](http://i.imgur.com/bx75q.gif)So there's this guy who comes into my gym, quiet guy but has some almost ritualistic behavior that I almost want to ask him about but don't want to come off like a dick.  

Now, I want to qualify by saying the guy lifts really heavy, so he obviously knows what he's doing. I think he's a powerlifter.  

A couple of things I'm curious about are:  

The way he racks his weights. Say you're pulling 325. That's three 45s on each side of the bar, right? Not for this guy. It's a 45, 3 25s, 4 10s and a 2.5. Because of reasons?  

The way he chalks up. Chalk on the hands? Not for this guy. Chalk on the bar. Takes a handful of chalk and rubs it on the bar. Maybe he just doesn't like the way it feels on his hands?  

Taking bumper plates off the olypmic lifting platform but never using the olympic lifting platform for his lifts.  

Quite guy, seems nice, just has some weird habits that make me scratch my head.That is absolutely horrible, but let's put things into perspective. The jacked guys in the room clearly see something in you that those two women are blind to. Focus your attention on the people who have your back and ignore the ones who don't.It is also a very clever way to dodge lawsuits. Mine takes away any weights that haven't been put back on the rack. If you feel you arent getting enough out of ICF try another beginners program like Starting Strength. It is very common for people doing a 5x5 program to switch to a 3x5 program after a while due to hitting a plateau.

Once you are ready for an intermediate program if you decide to focus on strength training consider Texas Method or Mad Cow 5x5. 5/3/1 really is a pretty slow progression for an intermediate. I'm not familiar enough with BB programs to recommend a similar level one.I've been using PB2, it's powdered peanut butterThere's a bit of misconception here.  Fat does not turn into muscle.  You need to build muscle by working out and eating lots of food and making sure you're getting protein.  The fat will go away by working out because you are burning fat.  The bottom line here is just start working out.  What you'll find when you strengthen your abs/glutes is that your erectors will naturally relax.

Seriously I'm sure it has its uses, just after reading Rip's book I can't bring myself to use one. Went to the gym, some guy took a bench into the squat rack, put weight on the bar, then held the bar up while he moved his legs side to side... fucking cross fit

Other story, this other guy was doing pull-ups in the squat rack (that's fine because this squat rack has the handles and grips for that purpose). He spent 10 minutes trying to maneuver a bar on top of the rack to do pull-ups or chins or whatever the hell. once he figured out how to get the bar up there, he proceeds to take 2 free weights and place them underneath, giving him a little height boost. **He spent 15 minutes trying to do the same excercise, just a foot higher which makes 0 difference to the workout**About 6 years ago I had to have carpal release surgery on my left hand.. Couldn't lift for about 3 months, but after 2-3 weeks I was doing cardio, and started doing bodyweight squats, calf raises on the stairs and a whole bunch of other bodyweight stuff (couldn't grip properly for a while). 
One of the good bodybuilder trainers at the gym and I had a good chat pre-surgery and he told me to be mindful of what I eat.. Keeping a good and healthy diet helps you keep what you have amd not pile on excess fat in the down time. 
Lost strength confidence as I didn't trust my grip for a while, did lose a chuck of size but once I started training the body soon remembered what it was supposed to be doing. 
As it was my hand I very quickly realised that leg press was my friend. One hand in use and my training buddy spotting closely allowed me to go fairly heavy on the legs fairly soon.

Obviously we are all different, but once the stitches are out and some structural healing had happened I felt confident enough to do some training. 

Tl/dr.. Keep your diet healthy, training legs is a good thing. Listen to your body. Look into programs that incorporates both strength and hypertrophy work a la ICF.

5/3/1 BBB is the most popular 5/3/1 routine and it incorporates extra volume for hypertrophy, especially if you add in a couple accessory movements. I highly recommend reading the book if you go this route.

PHAT and PHUL are other popular programs for experienced lifters that incorporate both strength and hypertrophy work.
Depends on how long you've been in that lifestyle. If you've been an office worker for 10+ years, then you won't see such drastic benefits immediately as someone who is more active.WOW!!! On livestrong???? Well then. This debate is settled.

But seriously fucktard- try pubmed.Thanks a lot man.  

Yeah i never post here because everything I'd recommend is what a lot of people here considered "advanced". If I see a post with aesthetics on the title I may comment.  

I thought SS or SL was so boring and PHAT looked fun. I think Picking a program you enjoy is very important.I mainly have been using smith machines for my bodyweight rows. It works great for them.
Was running this morning after bi tri day. My friggin nipples hurt. What can I do? About a week ago a gym member who generally is douchey and unpleasant called out a group of people saying "you always stand in front of the dumbbell rack(which they do)." This caused an argument and anyone within a 50 ft radius paused to watch a fight that could potentially unfold. I felt so conflicted because before i didn't really like the guy but he made a great point &amp; i learned that maybe some people aren't nearly as bad as they seem. - Joint by Joint Approach

The comeback is going to suck, but I already have the calender marked for when I can hit the gym again.Should have put him in the sharpshooter.There may be several reasons why one feels cold after losing weight, mine was wrecking my metabolism, OP's may not be.

You can't judge me based on that.Went from funny to gay real quickI just finished my first 5/3/1 circle and i think i can give you some tips if you want to get more into a strenght oriented programming.


Don't start to early 5/3/1 or other programms when you could easiliy progress on a 5x5 oriented split faster and easier.


If you ask me some good programms are:

5/3/1


Texas Method / Madcows 5x5


Canditos 6 Week/Linear Programm


Powerlifting To Win 


Cube Method


Given your lift numbers you might squeeze out some more strenght/muscles faster on a normal 5x5 routine with progression each time you get your reps than on a programm.I mentioned in the post I would probably be getting them even if I didn't do 5/3/1 because the reviews are so good. 

PHAT and PHUL are over 3 days a week and that's what I am trying to stay limited to because of my distance running. Otherwise PHAT would be at the top of my list. &gt; Deal with it.

The official cree of the cuntmuffin. Yeah, when someone gives me unsolicited advice I just say "thank you" and move along. The risk of injury makes a lot of sense, I try and be as careful as possible with my form but I can see how at 5x5 form could go out the window. Thanks for the input!promised it breakfast in the morning if that helps at allSays one who has never tasted turd, it's like people against cannibalism, once they've had the man meat they turn their tunes quickly. My girlfriend did a free crossfit session to get confident earlier this week - now she's coming to my PL/BB gym to drill formA regular occurrance at my LA Fitness - https://scontent-ord.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/1389813_697573163603711_790688593_n.jpgYes.  Tight hip flexors are the major cause of anterior pelvic tilt.  I see it a lot with my cycling and triathlon clients because their hips are flexed for extended periods of time.  Tight hip flexors (psoas in particular) inhibit the glutes and causes the lower back (and ITB) to tighten up to help provide the stability that the glutes aren't providing.  So stretch out the psoas and strengthen glutes.
The fire alarm went off in my gym this week too! I was sad because I had just set up for bicep curls and didn't get to do them. Seriously, don't. Most women do not go to the gym to be picked up. If you see her on your way in or out it wouldn't be rude, but there's nothing more invasive and annoying than some random guy coming up to you when you're trying to focus on your workout. It's always made me feel like I'm on display (which is a super icky feeling). But really, do not be the guy who thinks the gym is a good place to pick up women. &gt;I am trying to gain mass and wanted to switch to a new workout plan

First thought is that a 4 day Upper/Lower like PHUL might be better suited to your needs. I've had more stimulus (read: gains) running PHUL than I did running PPL. You hit each body part 2x a week, while maintaining a schedule. 

PPL will end up with you skipping a day in between lifting modalities with one week being M/W/F and the next being S/Tu/Th, revolving. The alternative is doing PPL 6x a week, which is taxing and hard to keep up with. 

However, if you're intent on sticking to PPL, I would actually rearrange it to Push/Legs/Pull. Madcows, Westside, and the like all operate on a premise of splitting upper and lower days even in 3x a week modalities. What's would be a good source of potassium? I eat a banana every day so I though that pretty much covered it.There should be laws about reheating fish at work. For the sake of your colleagues and coworkers, don't do it. Used to run a ton in the army and would always get them. One day running with a new squad leader he told me to try breathing in two breaths through the mouth then one out. Something that small changed everything for me.I flip a heavy ass tire at the end of all of my workouts. the squats have helped tooIf my last warmup and first work set feel awful, sometimes I'll deload a bit and try and punch out more reps while focusing on form.I need to see it to believe it. My gym warns of it, but no action ever taken!lol one my buddies goes to an mma gym here in washington, hes 6' 180 skinny fat build, but to push him they always pair him up with the 250 pound guy.

but I start with 15 reps BEFORE I do ATG squats
and then go back to frog squats with light weight (40lbs-60lbs) 3x8
your ass will really hurt, hope this helps
and also hip thrusts while doing pulses.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxhWS59Fvb8In order to train properly you should have a basic knowledge of anatomy. Nothing too extraordinary, but you should be able to keep up with the names of basic musculature and kinematic definitions (to a degree).

If you disagree? That's your opinion. I for one know that my clients appreciated learning these things.This. Warmup sets are just as crucial as your 1x5 deadlift max. They promote good form and get your body ready for your one set max, which by all rights should punish your body. You should be sweating like crazy after your 1 set max. I have even felt lightheaded as we'll after a 1 set max DL.

If you feel like it's not enough, try de-loading after your 1x5 max weight once or twice as a cool down - this will ensure good form because you're lifting less weight. As soon as you feel like your form is starting to slip, stop deadlifting - give your body time to recuperate.

I also incorporate pause deadlifts into my warmup sets to ensure my form stays constant. Check out this video here (the deadlift portion is halfway through the video) 
http://youtu.be/D0WeXbwFvPY

Good luck with the deadlifts!&gt; well this guy is the classic shit tier trainer. you'll notice he never gives time for the person to respond to anything hes saying. its a strategy to stop them from disagreeing with him.

I am pretty sure he is doing this because the demonstration is being filmed and as such the information is being presented in a way that is easily consumable by the viewer.

Rippletits stopping to discuss the finer points of the squat with the demonstration person would only provide information specific to that person, which provides no benefit to the viewer(who is the actual trainee).I don't think that was it. I watched him rep 5 wheels the other day. Maybe he's just a dickThe post leg day limp should be called Brahldar's Gait.That's the reason they don't have low weight dumb bells in prisons, stops prisoners using them as weapons when they're pissedLooking better than I expected. Do yourself a favor and perform few goblet squats. They don't need to be super heavy. For diagnostic purpose 15 pounds is all you need. If you can hit depth in front loaded squat, your general mobility is good enough and you should play around with few things in your back squat.

Try this: wider stance. It might mean lowering the weight because your hip adductors will get worked more than they are used to, but you may feel more comfortable in the longer run and it should make easier to hit depth. 

Two - despite having the bar in high position, start the squat by pushing your hips a little bit back, then bend your knees. It will cause your torso to lean a bit more forward and place the bar over the middle of the foot in the process.  
The fact that you feel the weight on your toes comes from bar drawing you back; then your body does everything to keep you in balance, hence the rising heels.

Three - if you can afford it, get weightlifting shoes. You don't need to drop 200$ on adipowers or romaleos, cheaper ones like do-wins will do their work too. You might get good results by using small plates under the heels, but personally I don't like this method.

Four - paused squats. You seem to have sticking point halfway through the concentric part. Get as low as possible, hold this position and then raise up. Again, this means lowering the weight, but should tremendously help you with generating power in the bottom, as there will be no 'bounce' from stretch reflex to get you through the first part of ascend.Breath in for three steps, breath out for three steps. No need to get fancy And then black people are in fym clothes outside of the gym the most.Ok thank you! 

I have read a little on the Texas Method so I have material on that to go through but I haven't heard of Mad cow so I will check it out. I will also try switching up programs and see if that does the trick. You hit the nail on the head.  Behavior is contagious.So non relevant but interesting story. Theres this highway on ramp in Portland i use going home from work, and by the time im on it it is usually 10-15 mph crawl. Anyway  one day theres a massive butt plug on the side of the road and i pointed and laughed and the car behind was laughing too. Next day theres another one. Day after one more! So for a whole weeks commute i always laughed at these two blue and one beige butt plugs.

Now theyre gone. And it honestly doesnt look like they were swept up by a sweeper as theres debris still everywhere. So now im left with more questions. Who just grabs butt plugs off the side of the road?!&gt; The squat video is so incredibly homoerotic.

So, it is like pretty much all activities relating to the lifting of weights?Yeah 15 as a total goal. So 3 per set but go for four if it's in the tank. 
I just keep track of what weights I use[Cleaning house](http://i.imgur.com/w8NZO61.jpg)wow


wowHalf and quarter squatters every day, man.  

"I can squat three plates!" They think.  
So can I if i don't actually move the weight, bro.   

But what do I know? I've only been lifting for like 2 years. I am trying a new mantra.

"Exercise might be best understood as a drug with powerful benefits, especially for cardiovascular health. As with any potent drug, establishing the safe and effective dose range is critically important—an inadequately low dose may not confer full benefits, whereas **an excessive dose might produce harmful effects that outweigh its benefits. Running marathons for decades may be an excessive amount of exercise**, possibly predisposing to an increase coronary artery plaque buildup despite favorably altering many risk factors such as weight, blood pressure and risk of diabetes. A more moderate dose of exercise might be a better strategy for promoting long-term cardiovascular health and durability."It's exactly that. Complete bologna. Considering the fact that most schools are pushing students to have at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day, the guy is talking out of his ass. It's probably his excuse to not work out.Yeah, at my YMCA the old men blow dry their genitals with the blow dryer as well as shaving their face as they stand butt-ass naked in front of the mirror.  I hate that place sometimes.So I was at the gym last week and this pretty skinny looking guy comes in, does some stretches and heads over to do some squats. He loads each side with about 130lb. I'm thinking there's no way he's going to be able to do that. So gets in position and lifts the bar on onto his shoulders. He does down about 2 inches and then back up. Literally 2 inches. He finishes his set of 10 and then loads more weight on and does the same.I'm pretty sure that's universally frowned upon/ poor gym etiquette.Thanks! I appreciate itThank you for thisYeah, all those technical terms Rippetoe uses to describe body parts are obviously just made up. Dude is clueless.Old guy at my gym "I used to be a competitive bodybuilder! I was huge. I was on steroids. Don't do those, they mess you up. I had a successful business, but I lost everything."   

Nice guy, but I think he spends more time telling everyone his life story than he does working out!Sorry for the wall of text! 
I normally workout at home, but my friend invited me to his gym and got me in for free today. Soooo many hot girls in the weight room, but a lot of them had shockingly bad form and i couldnt go up to them and offer advice because it would be viewed as trying to hit on them. No. I just want to stop them from snapping their shit up.  Yeah, I am just super nervous in there, and I don't want to step on any toes! It doesn't help that my university weight room is small, so if it's busy it feels so much worse than it actually is, cuz we're all crammed in there!I have APT pretty back so would I do these exercises like lifting exercise and do 3 sets of 10-12 reps, etc. or? Also how often and how long does it usually take to start fixing it? Sweet! My gym is 30 min away and plays obnoxious techno/dance music all day. But they have a cage, 2 ladder racks and an olympic platform and it's usually not too crowded.It's possible. I never deadlifted until last week. I did 315 for 5 reps.  It all depends on what other exercises you do that work those same muscles. for example, 5 plates and a 25 on t bar row under hand grip, 5 plates on [this](http://img.diytrade.com/cdimg/1324756/17930861/0/1293900590.jpg). Full weight on seated machine row. 230 lbs wide grip cable pull downs  after training that way for years deadlifting 315 for 6 reps is plausible no doubt. Uh yea, how else are you going to make sure all the groceries make it from your car to your house in one trip. This happened last Sunday but I've been saving it for today.

I was training my chest with my buddy, both relatively new to the gym. We finished on the bench press and a PT came in with a very obvious new client, never lifted an ounce before in his life by the looks of it.

Anyway, the PT proceeds to show the new guy how to bench. All goes well. Next, he whacks out a huge rubber band, loads up 60kg on the bar and puts one end of the band over the end of the bar, passes the band under the bench and loops the band on the other side of the bar.

I have no idea if this is a legit technique or not, supposedly to increase power I heard him saying due to creating more resistance during lift off and pushing the bar back up.

Really pleased for the new guy that he didn't get killed though and managed to do a full rep and then re rack before saying he wants to deload.


Don't be the guy who acts all friendly, and then goes and talk shit behind his back.I mean it more as in do you keep the weight the same through all sets or increase during sets?Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

The dry winter air usually doesn't help if you live somewhere cold and not coastal. A cough that lasts more than like an hour after an intense cardiovascular workout just doesn't sound normal! Haha, no, it's just that there's no other option. I'm not going to downgrade my workout because my gym is too cheap to buy enough stuff. If someone wanted to bench two plates while you benched two plates, but there was only 14 total plates, who are you gonna get mad at? Are you gonna get upset at the guy for not lifting less weight so you can have a go at the same time? Granted, the situation is different in your original example because the guy had other options- similar to curling in the squat rack. I have no other choice in my example.

When you clean, you should be pulling the bar to your belly button and *getting UNDERNEATH* the bar. This is why speed is essential. Once you start really moving weight, you're never going to be able to yank it like that anyway, so nailing the form is crucial. 

If you watch yourself on film, you'll notice that you're most likely allowing your arms to swing the weight, which would snap your forearms if you were to put that load on them with 100+ kilos.

Thank you for the advice and suggestions!Hey do you go to easy gym? (oxford)?[Can I be cool too?](http://i.imgur.com/ZYzOhct.jpg)

Long time svunter, first time assposter.I go to a super cheap gym that everyone makes fun of, and everyone there is  awesome.  everything wiped down in between, even when you're like "don't sweat it I'm good" they're like "it'll only take a second",  weights always put away.  I think the customers of the gym make more difference than the gym itself. I did 5x5, PHAT, PPL, several of my own routines, and right now it seems like the brosplit works best for me. Some tweaks to it, but I do chest monday, back wednesday, shoulders friday, and legs saturday. I feel like I'm hitting everything much better when I focus like this. It really is just a matter of jumping around and finding what suits you best.What in the world is that woman in the pink doing in your front view video?! It's like squats mixed with trying to loosen a wedgie...That looks like an exercise I should do in my living room.  How do you add weight to that?What a blowhardDamn, thanks for correcting me,  must've read over it.Yeah, I'm not talking shit, I'm just a tad disappointed. And I will directly say what I think to him.

If you don't think you are doing enough deadlifts change it so you are doing them moreforgive me, but what does DOMS mean?
Push-ups outside of a closed gym *in the snow*Check out /r/leangainsThat story sounded so much like me (me being the little guy) I was so scared. But then again, I didn't hear nobody speak about my 3/4 assed squats and I didn't go to the leg presses after. You got my adrenaline pumping there!If it's worth anything… I'm a guy who always tries to make things work, but in this case if I had an employee at the gym act like this…even if it's just to set precedent, I would fire them that day, maybe on the spot.So I was on the treadmill (shut up, there's two fucking feet of snow) and this extremely attractive woman starts walking towards me.  Tight clothes, killer body, gorgeous face. 

As she nears, i suddenly get a whiff of her perfume. Then I am assaulted by an overwhelming stench of perfume. By the time she is next to me I am literally dizzy from the smell. It's awful. I'm certain this violates the Geneva Convention. I may have blacked out, I can't be sure. 

She strolled off, leaving me to battle nausea and tremors brought on by her war crime of perfume. Haven't been on a treadmill since.



Neither, not YMCA and not Oxford. My gym has a bevy of independent trainers, outnumbering the gym's set of trainers probably 5-to-1. They are in some cases the most discourteous people in the entire facility. They leave weights all over the place, of course. On top of that they insist on super-setting with their clients on machines you want to use or are using, they take up entire areas with their damn equipment, and honestly put you down for being in their way because their client is on a schedule. It's pretty frustrating. The gym's trainers are incredibly nice, on the flip side.Damn that's harsh. 

Keep at it bro. I wish mine would. Assholes like to leave five 45 pound plates on shit. I'm a woman. That shit is heavy. Not to mention I'm either paying for childcare or using my precious kidfree preschool hours at the gym. I don't want to be spending ANY time putting away other people's shit. I get the same feeling. Planet Fitness would love that though. I signed a paper saying they aren't liable and I would be continuing to pay them without the burden of actually going to the gym.That's pretty good progress. I wish I was 6'7, couldn't squeeze out the last half inch to get me there. also as for cuts of steaks  http://whatscookingamerica.net/Beef/CookingPerfectSteak.htmSo I've been doing it wrong all these years?

"The gym already has a place for curls.

I pick the in my opinion most important of these exercises and see how far I can go.
I have seen the video but have never encountered problems, maybe due to my EZ curl bar? My wrists seem to be at a convenient level with it when I do upright rows.

Would you recommend I split my workout into an "every muscle twice a week" routine? What should I do when in that case?I do squats while waiting in line That isn't true you can use them for pull ups and rack chins as well!Fruit flavors are the most disgusting. 

Blend in peanutbutter for flavor or just buy tasteless and drink it with milk With what /u/czi said, there are a few explosive and Olympic style lifts where you are taught to jump when you do this. It's actually possible early on in training when your weight is still light or if you are a female in this case to actually jump. I don't know much about Oly lifts, but I know trying to jump is very important for the power clean.Forgot my headphones yesterday, everyone talked to me.I've found that if you go to the SLC around 1-3 it's not too busy, but I don't know if that fits your schedule.But doesn't the elliptical wear down the hip? It's such an unnatural movement.I'm really sorry. Don't let other people's meanness get to you, okay? People that can sleep at night after behaving like that aren't worth your emotions anyway. That's your energy, save it for something important. Don't let them take it.Lifting heavy on a machine and never developing your stabilizers and then trying to squat normally (free) and still trying to get that high weight is how you get hurt.  If you ever switch to normal lifts starting at low weights and progressing slowly is recommended. I hate to say it, but if you want to continue progressing you are just going to need to find a new gym. If your current gyms dumbbells only go up to 50lbs you are going to have to be inventing all kinds of alternative, less effective movements for every lift. It just is not workable even in the short term.They do have CCTV and I am a bit of an exhibitionist so it could be a great idea. &gt; more than an hour and a half of exercise A WEEK is DANGEROUS for you and will have a higher chance of dying

Crap. I do 1.5 hours every day. I must be dead already.
Happened to me at the urgent care when I messed up my right shoulder. The PA ~25 year old chick was checking each part of my arm from wrist up asking about pain. When she got to biceps she said "wow you have some great bicep muscle, omg it's like the size of my leg!" Swolestation at its bestIf you gonna use the smith machine at all, you can't really bash someone else no matter what they're using it for. That being said - who uses the smith for presses? That's like training balance on a balance pad that's not actually a balance pad but your couch and you're not actually standing on it, you're slacking and surfing reddit.because that's like going to a doctor, being overweight, and the doctor saying, "check out this fatass, what a slob!"  Not only is it morally bankrupt, its extremely unethical.  I garauntee that this people laughing are insecure and would cry a river if they heard the same thing about them.  On that note, get back in the gym, and go harder than ever before!  let it be motivation!What the Fuck is wrong with you asshole? I lived it. I don't need to cite any other fucking sources. Just because it doesn't make sense to your simple mind doesn't mean it isn't so. Do your own research you mindless gutless fuck.Don't worry it's good advice. ThanksYeah dude, see? She asked me "how often do you workout?" I replied "1 and a half hours a day" and she scoffed and said "yeah, that's not good".Idiots[This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Muscle-up.gif)I don't really get the half squat people either.. twice the weight, little of the benefit of the movement. Not my problem though and neither was it his. Sounds like a meat head.Just look onto http://www.strstd.com/ and http://www.exrx.net/Testing/WeightLifting/StrengthStandards.html to know where you stand. 

OT: Also exrx.net is a great ressource for guidelines and templates building your own routine. Many guys here and arround the gyms just won´t understand that routines follow a simple guideline/template. If you build something arround that with your own preferable stuff and you enjoy it it´s a good routine.

Just wanna say don´t overthink this stuff. Hiting plateaus this early is more like a technic issue or you just don´t eat enought.
Assisted bodyweight exercises. I'm still too unfit to do pullups or push ups.Is all good.  I got the "angry" interpretation from his use of "grrr"  :PSo many women complain CONSTANTLY about guys doing this to them in the gym, you would think these two would know better than to do it themselves.

I'm a woman and, yeah I do notice if I'm benching more than a guy next to me (rarely) but jeez, no need to be rude about it. Or say anything about it. It's just a thing. 

Sucks this happened to you and knocked your confidence but you've reminded me to mind my own damn business whatever I'm doing in the gym, so thanks for that.I hit a new PR on squat(325lbs!). After that, I moved on to deadlifts. A guy in the area next to me was explaining deadlift form to a girl. She wasn't really understanding it. He said, "Just watch what that guy does" and pointed at me. [MFW I heard that](http://i.imgur.com/FbBhjaT.png).Fuck the pigsIt isn't an alternative but it can be a good addition to a treatment planWell, using their logic, none of my exercise is running, so I'm good. ;D
It doesn't make sense because there is absolutely no evidence that fat people get hotter or colder than skinnier people. Do they require more effort to pull their fat asses around? Yep.

I guess we'll ignore the real science like...ummm.... coupled/uncoupled mitochondria and the variations among humans (especially races) and feelings of "hot and cold".

Nice try though fat ass.Be honest now, not hard to do. Look, some races like the germanic race and especially dutch people are very very tolerant for milk and milk products.

Others like Asians are very very intolerant too it. 

If you get inflammation and diarrhea from 0,5litre stop taking it. 

I got indestructible bones and i drink 1 litre milk a day and alot of other milk products like cheese,  yoghurt, "vla".....  Etc.

Fresh milk is generally better than milk thats good for 6months+ since its threated differently. 


Hope that helps man Was squatting in one squat rack, chick is squatting in the next rack over. Her pin defects and somehow, she manages to tilt and lose a plate (25 lbs) on one side causing her to flip to the other. There should be like a three foot clear-zone for the dumb bell rack.  I just stopped giving a fuck not too long ago, and now will just go grab any dumb bell I need, people just get out of my way so it works.  I know it's not nice, but shit, I have things to do. Nothing worse than hurting yourself on a squat. Its usually my first workout so if I fuck up on a squat it basically kills the workout. The guy above me said you introduced him to two if his favourite new terms. I jokingly asked if they were triceps and rope... You know like a jokeYes, you can get big arms curling lighter weight. Extensive hypertrophy can be achieved at a 15-20 rep range. Bodybuilding isn't about moving a weight, it's about working muscle.. Things like your chest on the other hand will require lower rep ranges. Bodybuilders like Arnold and Kai preach things like this.I used to do back/bis, chest/tris, shoulders/legs.. recently switched to a 5x5 full body just to see how it feels and I'm really enjoying the change. Not sure what results will be yet.... but the change in routine is really refreshing.Hey man. I can offer you a bit of personal experience, and a little science. Firstly, were the antidepressant something that brought down your cortisol levels, or was it something that amped up your positive chemicals? (like dopamine or whatever) I found that limiting cortisol helps more than flooding your brain with the positive chemicals.
Anyway- the personal experience bit. I started lifting when I got into a dark place, and for me it did wonders. Really helped turn my life around. So I'd say give it a shot, but if it doesn't work for you, or you feel yourself going into a dark place again, please just try new meds. Or both. Dealing with depression is kinda trial-and-error, I think. Hope this helps,I've never gotten their whole philosophy. "Everyone is welcome...unless you are in shape or can lift dumbbells heavier than 50 lbs"Same weight throughout setsThanks, I'll keep that in mind if I can switch gyms in the future and I get to use a squat rack.All my other exercises are with free weights.Yeah it tears the fuck outta my shoulders. I try not to do itHe's not your bro, buddy. (Southpark reference)I love cooking, pretty good at it actually, just need to start cooking more, and healthier recipes. 
In a couple months I'll be off to college, and it just doesn't make sense in the short term to spend money when I have a free alternative.No no!! This is free gainz. When you rerack all their weights you are getting their lost gainz. I go to the YMCA as well. I almost never see unused weights on the floor.that looks pretty coolAnother point on mental acuity: Stop binge drinking if you are engaging in that even occasionally. Alcohol and substance abuse looks like dementia when you get older. Binge drinking is especially bad for your brain. Diabetes and even non diabetic but elevated blood sugars are also highly correlated with dementia later in life, so watching your carb intake and having a good diet will also help your mental acuity. But the alcohol and substance use thing- I work with older adults and those who have a history with alcohol or substances definitely show it in their cognitive functioning. ): It's an important health factor and shouldn't be forgotten here.It feels like muscle ache. Putting on the heat wraps help but only until they wear off. Good for keeping the forever-smalls off the racks/benchNah, I think watching a grown man doing shrugs across a parking lot would have made my day. It sounds adorable.Thanks! Yea I built a GVT routine based on the 3 day/week variation. I have no doubt I am pretty over thinking it a bit so I will pull myself back from doing that. It could be technique but I am pretty obsessed with form. I deloaded several times just to smooth it out and have a member of the training staff do a form check on certain exercises now and then. I am gaining weight too but only at about half a pound a week right now. sounds like an asshole move, buuutttttt, more funny, so you get my up vote!Did you tell them you wanted to use it? I've noticed most people will move if you ask nicely and they aren't actually using the area for the designated purpose.That sounds kinda fun! This happened to me. I was on the elliptical and then proceeded over to the squat rack. I saw that someone had left the barbell at the third from the top row with 90 pounds of weight on it. So I stood around for five minutes waiting to see if someone was coming back. I'm 4'10 and only squat 60lbs right now, but I found out I can in fact lift the 45 pound plates from way above my head and put them away, so I guess they did me a favor?  1 pound of chicken, 6 eggs, a liter of milk and you're done.

That's like 170g of protein, so with half a liter of milk you have 155g.Was his age group over 90?I certainly hope you're not talking about BECOMING an MMA fighterI do jerks like 3 times a week, it helps a lot with building explosiveness for push presses and locking out more weight overhead.

To be fair though it looks and sounds really strange if you've never seen it before.

Should also probably note that I'm training for strongman so I'm just worried about getting the most weight overhead that I possibly can, and the best way to do that is to leave the ground and use your arms to push yourself underneath it into a full lockout, the arms don't do any work, it's all legs and shoulders for stabilization.Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

This is the only thing I have found that leaves my ass sore for days afterwards. Not that being sore is indicative of a good workout, but I can heavy hip thrust, squat and deadlift all day and though I can feel my glutes working, they never hit me as hard as front rack lunges.That's the way to go. 

Dumbbell curls are superior in my opinion anyway, since your left and right arm usually are not equally strong. And with a barbell you lose the form trying to get this thing up.

Use really light weight. 4lbs? No problem! Don't mind the others. You will gain strength if you continue to do the exercise. 
If I start to work out after a longer period I always use light weights to start. And biceps are small muscles and you don't want to make them sore the first day but you want to do some curls the next day and the next and the next. Cow milk is like 1 euro for 2 litre, almond milk is 4 euro for 1 litre.

8x the price. I seem to just get an unruly amount of unwanted advice. From being told lat - pulldowns are meant to be full-body workouts to being told I was curling too much and that I had too much range of motion. 

Anyway, 2 days ago I was working my shoulders with some lateral raises. I'm on my second set when I hear this guy behind me say "bend your knees". I wasn't sure if he was talking to me so I kept going. Sure enough he just keeps saying it over and over, and at this point I realize he's staring at me through the mirror. I put down my weights after my set is done and turn around to see what he means. He says I should bend my knees when doing lateral raises so that I don't put so much pressure on my knees. I always want to keep an open mind, but is there any possible way that makes any sense? I tried what he suggested and saw no real difference other than looking like I was about to take a shit. Dude was using one of only two squat racks in my gym to curl the bar with 10 lb plates on it. I just don't get people.Nice work man. The definition is really coming through!I use a simple squat rack at home instead of a cage.  It's not as safe as a cage if you're pushing yourself to the point of failing sets, but I'm extremely cautious and it works for me.  Just throwing that out there since you're gathering information.  I'd recommend the cage if you have the room, though.Than explain why they give soya treatments to menopause women.Many ppl who have lost 100 lbs or more are evidence. Unlike your stupid skinny ass.

Fucking Moron.I found that it definitely helped with anxiety and depression issues I was having.  It wasn't the only things that brought me out of my darkness, but it did play a big part.  Eventually I was able to wean off all my medication and have felt better in so many ways.  Good luck and stay strong!  Always believe in yourself.Nah goof.

The smell, how do I describe. Vinegar would be too nice. IDK, this was some new scent foreign to me until then. Needless to say I left the bench press area and just did some back work contemplating how many other smells are out there, lingering, ready to cause havoc on your nostrils.A guy got threatened in the locker room with a gun because he was staring at a guy changing.

At the end of a set of 10 front squats my wrists are killing me.4 hours??I like the plain and simple "no" lolYeah that too. If you're working on muscle ups I personally think it's better to get partway through the transition, fail, and try to control the descent than it is to cheat the transition. You complete imbecile. Fat people get hot because they have to exert more energy pushing that fat ass body around. You do understand what a mitochondria is and how it works?

Sorry for my /r/SquaredCircle reference. Mmmmm...  Philly cheese steak... He was about to ask you out but got nervous and ran: fight or flight reaction. Holy shit. Thank you for this Thanks for the response! I'll try it outI OHP my car.Actually, straight up, make my girlfriend black, and it's accurate enough that I'll print it out and frame it.High bar always gets my glutes pumping. Eventually you'll progress to a point where the quads are strained. That's why I dislike the SL. It doesn't deal with having to squat and deadlift heavy continously. Mehdi just slapped few lifts together, ripped off 5x5 idea from Reg Park (who in fact used 3 work sets and two 'official' warm up for total of 5) and 'programmed'  in deloads. Just like Rip did it in SS two years earlier. It seems like it didn't cross his mind that at some point the B workouts gonna be hella tough - three heavy squatting and two heavy pullin sessions.

End of rant. Speaking of SS - it rotates between deadlifts and power cleans after few weeks and as of third edition it adds back extensions even further into program to allow sufficient recovery for deadlifts while allowing to still squat heavy three times a week. 
[It looks like this about half way through second-third month and beyond](http://i.imgur.com/Nsi5ggN.jpg).  
This way you pull heavy just once a week. I've also seen variation where squats on deadlift day are made in 2x5 fashion with lower load (80% of what you would do otherwise).

Phrak's Greyskull variant also separates deadlifting from squatting and I would advise doing something like that - either separating those two completly or lowering the workload of squats on days you'll be pulling.This is not ok,report it immediately bro ,owners newphew or notNot sure if you mean it in a negative way, but I hate that... I never try to continue a conversation with anyone. I just want to workout and leave. aint nobody got time for that.Dude, fuck those women. Like really, you're more than a number, whatever you can do, keep doing it.

They also don't know what has happened to you. What happen if you have a shoulder injury and you can't lift more? The hell with what other people says.

Keep it up buddy and stay strong!!Tuna patties - I'm serious, these things are gold, and cheap.

Basically, get 4 cans of tinned tuna (the salt water variety)

Drain and empty into a mixing bowl and add 4 tablespoons of mayo. Next, add some whole wheat breadcrumbs and sunflower seeds (If you're into that sort of thing...), garlic and onions too if you want. 

After mixing it all together, get your hands in there and make burger patties.  Slap it on the pan and cook each side evenly. This should sort you for a week. That sounds a lot like hyperventilatingYESSSS! I was doing incline dumbbell press the other day while some guy shrugged right at the rack. It was like his ass was in my face the whole time. So awkward...I really hope that guy's job was to sell stuff. Why, well cause I'm pretty sure he could make anyone stop and listen to him with sales pitches like thatAre you the guy that squats with the bumper plates? I realize curling in the squat rack is a joke, but a couple days ago I was at the gym and a dude was curling in the squat rack, and his legs were like twigs.  It was hilarious, his calves must've been smaller than my wrists.So really the argument is semantics. Fine, let's get to the detail then and actually define it... A light curl for me is 125 lbs. I can curl that until I'm bored. So I can gain inches on my arms by curling that rather than going up to, say 200 lbs and actually putting a load on my biceps? 


However for chest you do use more weight, less rep?

Im really just trying to figure out what bullshit I was spewing when I gave a general high level sort of recommendation. Cuz that bullshit is how I typically work out, and it's gotten me results. For the curious:

[TCU Baseball 2012 - The Grind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNL_DAI19_I)

Nice motivational video. I saved it and will extract the audio to get me up and pushing forward.People who do this kind thing (at the gym and in life): do you rationalize your behavior to yourself or do you just generally feel entitled because of who you are? Serious question. I would really like to understand your thought process. You have to join a gym to be an exhibitionist. I was trying to highlight the next progression in the usage of an empty gym.   Yeah dude 90% guys hate leg days.  Your form looks pretty good at parallel.  I suggest playing with location of bar on back(could try lower) and consider wider stance if you like(less pressure on knees and back).  There is no perfect squat you have to find what feels natural for your anatomy.  Also don't do heavy cardio the day before.Well I'm trying to get muscles really Yeah, have a look at my sonNo worries, I totally missed that. I figured you were open to lifting more times per week since you listed 5/3/1 but I guess you'd go the full body route in that case. One option is to throw in more accessories/volume to that routine.

The only other non-strength program I can think of that has a 3 day version is [lyle mcdonald's generic bulking routine](http://www.jcdfitness.com/wp-content/download/Lyle_McDonald_Generic_Bulking_Routine_FAQ.pdf)
Ask your MD. Also /r/eoodI'd believe you if you said you OHP your *cart*.  Now that is something I wouldn't mind seeing as I ~~walk~~ farmerwalk down the meat aisle. Congrats man.. thats a huge milestone!I work and go to school about an hour away from home but I come home once every week or two to help my parents out with things they're getting too old to do for themselves. 

Last weekend they had the city come and drop off some new trees to be planted and my dad wanted one to be moved to the backyard.

The tree itself wasn't too large yet at all, but it was sitting inside a very large bucket filled with so much dirt it may have well as been cement. My dad didn't know how we were going to move it. Had to be at least ~200+ lbs.

I proceeded to squat down really low, grab it around the bottom of the bucket like an atlas stone, and squatted that shit up and walked it into the back yard. Dad said he was impressed and proud.I can´t really understand yet how you wanna alternate your hypotrophie and strenght routines? 
Sure some weeks of many accessiory movements will help strenght and muscle gains but to be strong you need to be atleast on a 80% lbs of your max on your lifts, more like you need to be atleast a few times a month on 90%. GVT or OVT you throw in just some high volume till you puke. That could benefit your muscle gains but your ability to lift in higher % will suffer and what is (for me) more important, the reattaining of that ability will be not just a 4 week circle. It will painfully last a long time learning lifting heavy.Just making sure because there are [women with higher numbers](http://www.goheavy.net/records/viewrecordset.aspx?recordsetguid=f109c5a0-4b65-4f98-94a9-d4a2a40ba2a2). It's not by any means common, but well within the realm of possibility.

I'm not sure if you could milk a beginner program at this point, so SS and SL are probably out. I would say a good intermediate program might be what you should look for. 5/3/1 or texas method might be good. Or maybe Candito's program or GZCL method. You can try googling those and see if you find any appealing. 

To be honest I've always run my own programming so I have no real experience with any of these, but they've all worked for other people. Shin splints, classic beginners injury, all the advice here is good, get decent shoes, build up your mileage slowly, cross train on days you don't run (bike, elliptical if you have access to a gym, weight training, swimming). 

Most importantly though, don't over do it and keep pushing and pushing, they do have a nasty habit of progressing to stress fractures if you don't take it easy on yourself. 

Running requires patience, take the time to build your fitness slowly, backing off for injuries when necessary and you'll enjoy it for a long time. Flog yourself through injuries that are never allowed to heal and you'll end up hating it. Yes that happens to lots of people If you plan on rowing for 20 minutes without dying, you're in for a terrible surpriseI do a lot of hanging leg raises and I have a hard time feeling it in my core. Any tips? This is a high-bar squat which is initiated by bending at the knees and sitting the ass straight down and trying to remain as upright as possible.  The low-bar squat is initiated by driving the hips outwards so you can maximize the amount of force your glutes and bring into the squat. I'm not going to shit on his parade, dude. As I said, I'm happy he's doing something, he's exercizing, losing weight and is having fun with it.

I am, however, going to point out some things about crossfit and strength and/or hypertrophy training, hoping he'll see the light and add some of this to his routine.

I like to be honest with friends, but I hate hurting their feelings, so it's more of a 'hey dude, have you tried/seen this, maybe you could try this and that because of this and that' instead of 'hey bro, that muscle up isn't real' kind of thing.I'm on the same boat, 12 hour shifts 6-7 days a week. Luckily for me I found a gym near my work that is open 24/7 so I go before work now. Before I found that, I created my own morning workout in my bedroom(lasted 20-40 minutes 3 times a week) it wasn't amazing but it got the job done and I seen resultsNot only outside of a closed gym, but in the middle of a blizzardI would take out incline bench press and do incline dumbbell bench press. Add in some chest flies and one more triceps exercise. For your pull day add facepull and more bicep work. Ppl needs more volume imo. Got to spot an NFL lineman on bench press. He was benching 295 for reps. Made my yearRemember, we're thinking healthy lifestyle here. You can't be getting drunk everything you cook. That's no bueno for the abs.I can't really see anything wrong with your form it's pretty good, you are going incredibly deep though but that's up to you how low you go. I would say just keep working on it maybe deload if you need to and just keep working on it, it will come along don't worry. I low bar squat and have a massive bubble butt.It's know to work for some individuals. Someone I know is using exercise instead of ante depressants, but when ever she's missing out on a workout, she gets really depressed by it. I thing you should follow your doctor's/therapist's advice on the matter.

One thing is sure though, you will feel better in many other ways from exercise.On most Saturdays, I have one of my grad school courses that goes from 9am-4:30pm. Today I don't thank god, but a few Saturdays ago I get out and head to the gym. I rush to get there so I can get my lift in ASAP while I still have the energy. As I'm parking I suddenly feel I have to drop a well condensed protein log. I go locker room, change, and go to the bathroom. I go to the largest stall on the far end, cause I like the opulence of a spacious stall. 

I'm midway through doing my business when I hear someone stomp in the bathroom. This guy storms into the first toilet. I'm not sure if it was out of toilet paper, but I hear him pressing against the walls and stomping. He says "You gotta be fucking kidding me!" and slams the stall door open. He bursts into the next stall (the one next to me), stomps more, and then exclaims a slew of curses as he bangs against the walls of the stall like a caged animal. I feel the stall wall that is separating me from this man bending from every kick or punch he is throwing. 

The poor toilet paper dispenser is smashed during the flurry of curses and blows, and a large piece of it flies under my stall. He then slams open the door and stands in front of my stall for a moment before I "occupied". He curses as he stomps out, then stomps back in a moment later, and sits in one of the stalls in silence.

I finish my business, wash my hands, and head out to warm up for my lift. Not that I needed to raise my heart rate, I just needed to stretch at this point. The idea of fighting off this man mid release and with my shorts around my ankles had already gotten my blood pumping enough and made every muscle tense up. I recognized him out on the gym floor by his shoes. Did my best to just go on with my workout and to avoid looking in his general direction. I still don't understand why he destroyed the toilet paper dispenser. One of the oddest gym/bathroom experiences I have had yet.That's when I'm typically there if I can be. My buddy has class during that time for two of our workout days though.  
For me, however, I've always found that the sweet spot is 10am. If he's not planning on going, I usually try to hit it then, and almost never have to wait for anything :)I developed some serious RSI and couldn't back squat, and I've had pretty good results front squatting with a cross grip. May be a good replacement for you, too. So I hired a personal trainer after I sustained a serious injury. She gives me a program and I do it on my own for 5/6 weeksish then she gives me another one to do. I've only talked to her 4 times over the last 5 months and she fucking hates me. Chick has known for for at most 5 hours and dislikes me hard. She's actually starting to be really unprofessional and I don't get her issue when she literally doesn't know me. But today she was working out/training when I was working out. She didn't say hi, didn't look at me, and turned her back to me whenever I was around. Then gives me a dirty look as she walks out the gym and I'm getting ready to leave. No idea what her issue is but acting like a bitch and wanting my money doesn't fly with me. 

Other than that I'm going in for surgery this week and will be out for two weeks which sucks. My surgery though has given me a huge amount of motivation and it's been one of my best training months ever. I've been really motivated lately. Looking forward to summer and showing off. [The 2:1 pulling to pushing thing is a rule of thumb that comes from a couple of different coaches. It's purported benefit is health and training longevity gained by the prevention of imbalances.](http://bretcontreras.com/topic-of-the-week-4-pushing-and-pulling-ratios/) I go to Blink fitness. It's one of the gyms that has three dozen treadmills, two dozen ellipticals and two power cages. But it's $20 a month and I live in Manhattan so I just go early in the day, it's fine. The two cages are off in a corner, right next to the assist dip/chin machine, which I use because my chins suck so I'm going light weight, 3x10 for now. Tuesday I didn't make it in until the evening, when it's a madhouse. So, I'm squatting, finishing my set, rerack everything and then turn to the dip/chin machine to get a few sets in, there's two women chatting. Not working out, not resting between sets. One of the women is in fact sitting on the foot rest of the machine. I've been eyeing in the mirror, she's been sitting on the machine for about ten minutes. Not a big deal, nobody has wanted the machine until me. 

I say, maybe overly politely, "hey, do you mind if I use the machine?" to which she stares at me like a deer in headlights and goes "well, no, I'm using it. I'm just about to get started." I asked if I could work in with her, she said "yeah I guess". We proceeded to trade off sets - me doing a timely work set, her doing a half assed set, pausing between reps to keep talking to the other woman who was with her, who also decided she was going to work in with us.

Took me twenty minutes to get three sets of chins in. *Fuck* evening hours.I think it is contagious. In between sets, I re-rack weights. It sets an example and now it's standard at my little gym. Re-racking someone else's shit is subtly shaming and no one wants to be shamed by an old muscle fart. Is there a female version of bro you can use?This is something you should talk to your doctor and/or therapist with, as they should be the ones to help you figure out what works best for you.

That said, for me personally, yes. Exercise (heavy lifting) helps tremendously with my depression.
One of the main reasons I lift is because I don't want to take meds. It works for me.Hodor.Seriously, kettlebells are a must for working out at home. Changed my life.Fuck what others think.. tape your workouts man, its extremely useful to people, like me, that goes to youtube for new workouts.. think about this, as they are judging you for something they wish they did, your helping others get swole and getting paid for it! Yes please.http://imgur.com/JpQO0Dm

Gave her a booty and no teeth. dont be a fag op, post proof.I do that with whatever tooling I'm using at work while waiting for a run to finish or for a spot to open at the sink to clean up. I took a two week break from heavy lifting. Due to vacation and sickness I got from the vacation. My(28m) PR's were bench 205. Squat 315. Deadlift 325. 
After I recovered from this bad head cold. I got back at, but I was working my way towards my PR'S. So I was lift 60-70% of my max. Even then the weight felt heavy. So it had me worried I was losing strength. 
So yesterday I decided to do a usually heavy workout I'd do for legs. 5 rounds. 315lbs deadlift x 7. Then jump rope for 1min. 
I warmed up and did my usual rituals. I was afraid to see if I could at least still lift 315. But threw the warmup two 45s didn't feel to bad. I just kept everything tight and took a deep breath. And bam! I still had it. Heck I even did 3 consecutively , instead of placing it down and regrouping. 
I felt really good after that workout. You are doing paused squats in the video. Do you always squat like that?can finally bench 135 and squat 135. A couple months ago I was benching 105 and squatting 95. I can see the improvement, and I love going to the gym now. I also made a few gym buddiesI went to a group class this morning on my OWN. It was body attack. It was super hard but I went and I'm so glad I did. I'm fed up of relying on other people to go with and then being let down. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't feel like my balance is being tested when I squat compared to say something like warrior 3.

Don't think you understand what mental acuity is. It's sharpness or keenness of the mind. Squats doesn't require this.  Looks fineBroliYeah, that makes sense.  I figured he was trying to sell me on something, but whatevs.  I'ma get big.Started at the gym two weeks ago going twice a week. On the first day, I could barely bench 145. I couldn't even do a full rep. On Thursday, I did a full set of ten with zero problems. It felt fucking awesome. Now we're going three times a week (Tues, Thurs, Sat). I love it. 

I used to be worried that others will look at me funny or judge me but when I'm focused on lifting more weight or running, I ain't even thinking about what others are doing.I drank the Iced Tea Rehab for awhile too because it was barely carbonated and I liked that. I've switched though to the "Zero Sugar + Zero Calories" ones. A gas station close to my house sells them 3 for $5 all the time. I wouldn't buy them otherwise. I wouldn't call it a bad habit as much as I would call it an addiction Never had a problem there. Are you just keeping your index and middle finger on the bar? It will keep your wrist from bending too far back. Gotta get your elbows high too so the bar is almost completely resting on your shoulders. Your wrists shouldn't support any weight, they just ensure the barbell doesn't roll forward. I don't believe in bulking/cutting.  After the 1st year, maybe 2 you are only going to gain a few pounds of muscle each year unless you are using juice.  So find your maintenance calories and add about 300 calories to that.  The reason I throw in peanut butter is 2 table spoons is about 200 calories.  Add some whole or 2% milk and you have your 300 calories or so without trying.Yeah it looks like a pretty full workout, thinking about it now 20 might end up being more than I bargained for lolThis just blew my mind. I gotta go try it out nowHonestly, I'd just focus on doing better contractions on your SLDL's, then focus on actual deadlifting in college. Try contracting for 2 seconds, hard, then holding for a second at the top, and lowering for 4 seconds, and holding the starting position for a second. Also, contract your lats hard all the way through it, and you'll build some more back strength. Weight loss is not linear.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/qg6vy/weight_loss_secrets_revealed_by_alan_aragon/PeyoCoyo enjoyed Bobo's story. PeyoCoyo hope Bobo have fun on coffee-date and talk more to pretty girl. Great approach. NoYou will. I'm working out with my gym partner training Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, making all kinds of gains...Then THAT guy walks in. Long pants, earbuds, hoodie. He was wearing earbuds in a gym that already plays music. He doesn't even change and his "gymwear" is already on. He walks straight to the squat rack and starts squatting with the bar (what?). Then he loads a few small plates on and does 5 struggling reps. At this point he sits down and his face is as red as a tomato. He sits on his ass for 2 minutes then does 5 more. At this point I think he is done, but then this idiot takes all the weight off his bar and starts Overhead pressing. What? Mr. Earbud does the same 5 forced reps like an idiot, panting from less reps than I do as warmup, he empties the bar again. Then he starts doing deadlifts with the SAME FUCKING BAR. At this point the entire gym is staring and we are laughing our asses off. Hoodieboy does 5 painfully struggling reps and then just gives up. He empties the bar once again and walks out of the gym. His whole entire workout lasted 30 minutes. My friend and I are practically in tears. Then this fucktard shows up 2 days later wearing the same clothes.
Lots of women go to the gym, they just don't go in the weight room so you don't see them. Also, society tells women they have to be *thin*, not necessarily *fit*, and you don't have to go to the gym to be thin. I make it a goal every time I lose 10 pounds to pick up a 10 pound sack of potatoes. I'm down 60 pounds and up 6 bags of potatoes. Aldi must think I'm weird.Any kind of chili with rice is good. Just put it in a reliable tupperware. Didn't know that was a prerequisite.

But aren't we just talking about activation?Thats how I do front squats I've just got piss poor wrist mobility.  It's something I'm working on.  Thanks for the info!They wussies.I was benching while these two guys were selecting music from their ipod to play through the gym speakers. You're able to do it but believe me their is so much unspoken rules about it that you needn't bother. It was only us 3 though so no big deal I let them get on with it.

They had some serious garbage playing but whatever I just popped Eminem's Til I Collapse on my phone while I did my last set, as is the style of the time.

Two guys come in while they're playing their poppy dance stuff and they seem to panic and put an Eminem track on.

This goes down better than you can imagine, the two new guys were rapping along, I was digging it. Then it ended and something else comes on...

The two new guys said, "Hey, put some more Eminem on!" This would've been great, the atmosphere for those few minutes were great.

"I've only got that one." wtf?? New guy #1 says "Uh... right well any rap will do".

He puts Dead Prez on you know that hip hop song from the 90s. They didn't dig this song at all, totally took them out the zone.

The music guys left, in shame I suppose and they started referring to him as the one hit wonder!

I thought it was a nice few minutes but you gotta take what entertainment you can get in the weights room lolI know that feel. 

I'm a very analytical person and I tend to overanalyze everything. "What's the best routine??? What's the best exercise of this??? What if I get too fat when I bulk?? What if I don't gain the "ideal" amount of strength??"

Working out and doing some calculations can be fun but when it's too much, it kills my mind on overdrive. A realization I had is that it's probably from comparing my progress to the ideal and to other people on the internet.

The most important part is you enjoy working out and seeing progress, even though not linear, and you'll just fine!Well. You should probably look to gain another thirty pounds or so as you continue to work out. Similar to my gym but with lots of neon running along the walls. But sold to awesome PT who has totally revamped it and my rates are grandfathered in at two-thirds of new members. Hang in there, a good gym is hard to find. Yes I always squat like that, if I squat faster or try to use the stretch reflex I kinda loose all of my tightness and then I am doing a goodmorning like movement. How can I improve and do this without loosing form? Because if I would go faster than I would be able to move more weight.How are your maxes 50% more than any of your working weights?My college has a gym and literally everyone and their moms uses the squat rack. This is definitely true. When I first started lifting I had flared elbows and it wasn't a big deal because the weight was light. However, because your shoulders act as stabilizers when your elbows are flared, I just couldn't physically do more than 185. All I did was tuck my elbows and my bench felt much more controlled and powerful once you get used to it. Now it's up to 225 from 185 2 and a half months ago.it doesnt affect it at all, just like water doesnt make pasta any less calories. 3 cups of oatmeal is just overkillYou keep saying that word. "Death". I don't think you are aware of how many people have to work extremely long hours in the world. It's not good, it's not healthy, but it's not gonna kill you.RIPYes it was always my goal to squat as deep as possible, and to do that on every single rep. Well the thing is that I wanted to deload but 60 kg suddenly felt way to heavy.
It is, and as a member of PF it annoys me, because if it's not a gym, then why the fuck am I there?Advice? Respect her privacy and go finish your workout. Because women are only required to be thin to be attractive, which can be achieved through diet alone fairly easily. Whereas men are constantly told they need to be buff, which requires going to the gym. Its all based off society's idealsEvery Saturday I see a woman, probably in her 40's, super fit (I'm M/27). I'd love to say something to her but I don't know what, I don't want to let her know my intentions, because it would be awkward if she isn't up to that.

Instead, I keep doing my strength routine and pretend she isn't there. Life sucks.Fuck, if I owned that gym I would fire her loudly in front of everyone and give you a free year. Fuck people like that. It's funny, the most intimidating looking people in the gym are usually the nicest, in my experience at least. The dedicated regulars have all been where you are. keep going and keep making progress and it will show.It is the hardest part man, I still have a bit, caloric deficit seems to be the only that works for me. I run before breakfast.  Make ur body feed off that fat. Skin is very resilient I think I will always have stretch marksYou can get that woman fired in a heartbeat.Show me the statistics.

I don't do much hardcore lifting, what does 'working in' mean?Nobody cares what you look like or how much you lift in the gym. Everyone is there because they want to look better than they do already. The anxiety can be gut-wrenching at first, but it goes away pretty quickly. I used to get it when i first started, but now the gym is my sanctuary, one of the places i feel best in. Just get in there and get started, and watch your diet. Read the sidebar for more infoi need the calories manI call the two hands dumbbell one "Pancake grip tricep thingy with the dumbbell"

the ones laying down with a bar are true skull crushers though./r/eood

Personally the zoloft clears the darkness enough to get me out the door, but I don't feel "good" unless I'm regularly exercising and eating right.  The effects of vigorous exercise combined with medication are greater than either by themselves IMO.&gt; i could join a gym but i'm scared about doing so. i would look at all the machines and have no idea what to do or how to use them. how long to spend on each one or even which one to use. i would also be very embarassed about exercising in front of people for example i would imagine that any girl could lift weights heavier than me, and guys twice as fat as me could run for longer and faster and i know people would see that and think im a loser.


It's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be. You can watch videos on YouTube to learn proper technique and learn how to use the machines. No one else is going to be paying attention to what you're doing, so there's no need to be embarrassed. One comparison that someone said before that I find accurate is that the gym is like a library. People go to do whatever work they need to do, and don't focus on what other people are doing. Be proud that you're taking steps to improve your lifestyle and go to the gym. http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_should_i_train_full-body_or_a_body-part_split.3FTaking turns &gt; just stating there is always a way to make do with less

There are plenty of people who're close enough to "nothing" that "less" isn't really a viable option. For these people, it's not a matter of "we'll just buy generic instead of name brand", it's a matter of "we won't be eating this week".After a year of slacking and only hitting the gym for yoga or spin class, I hit the weight section of the gym for the first time in over a year.  I was waiting on the squat rack and the guy using it before me was a friend from high school.  

He asked me what happened... Said that "for a minute there I was looking really beastly".   That isn't an adjective I'd give my body at the moment, but I know that if I was there a year ago, it won't take much more than getting into the groove of hitting the weights for a few months to be there again. 

That's my motivation. I want Jon to say I look beastly again. Theres a lot easier way to get calories than eating a shit ton of oats. Try things like peanut butter, nuts, whole milk, etc. Single leg romanian deadlifts.Uphill both ways!Pilonidal cyst's develop with bigger buts as well. I've had one before, I know your pain. :(Guys, I've shared a few stories of people in my gym fucking up.  I have a few more to share but this time it's about me... 

Shame in 3, 2, 1:

I'm no stranger to the gym but I've done mostly cardio in the past.  Last month I decided to try Starting Strength which I don't regret one bit.  Last weekend I was about to deadlift the heaviest weight ever.  Granted it was only 140 so comparing to you more experienced lifters, it's not much but for me it was my heaviest weight at the time.

I get myself into position, make sure my posture is good, I breathe just so I can prep myself.  "1, 2, 3, go!" I think to myself.  I proceed to lift the bar, I stall for a second but I but more power into my legs.  It's finally going up!  But in the process of lifting the bar, I let out a long, loud fart.  The fart went on the entire time I lifted the bar and didn't stop until it's all the way up.

I turn bright red and quickly put it down.  I look around to see if anyone noticed.  Of course they noticed but no one was staring at me nor were they laughing.  The other members are awesome because they could have ridiculed me for hours.Workout details please. Yeah, as if that was a new term? Thank you I haven't run across this one yet! :)That really sucks man, I know it can be embarrassing and hurtful but think long term here. So what if you didn't bench a ton of weight, that's why you're in the gym is to get fit and stronger. Use this women's pain to your advantage and see it as motivation. Any time you feel like you can't finish a workout or you don't feel like going to the gym just remember you got some bitch to prove wrong. Just remember op, not everyone is like that, some people just suck. Just remember that as you go down in weight, the amount of calories required to maintain your weight goes down as wellDefinitely should have known. But I would have kindly let them know that curls do not need to be performed in the squat rack, and that they're potentially stopping those from using it for its intended purpose.

If I didn't know any better, I would actually want someone to tell me rather than unknowingly pissing off other people.Holy shit, people know what i'm doing when I do that?!?!!!! OoI was going to just rotate between a strength routine and a hypertrophy routine. I.e run 5/3/1 all the way through then do GVT all the way through and repeated with rest periods in between. Then during cuts go to a cutting routine and then return back to alternating the other 2 routines.

If this is a poor approach please tell me I am very open to suggestions. I remember being asked to spot someone the first time when I was just 15. I was the only other guy in the gym and I turned it down because I didn't know how to, felt real bad after that but he was benching a shit load, there's no way I'd be able to save him back then.Shoe wouldn't help anyway. Broke my foot that way.I've got this thing about dumbbells.My lower back decided to tell me that my deadlift form is off...ouch. What were you doing with a 50kg barbell?!This is the greatest thing I've ever read, I can't believe I've been breathing wrong when I've ran for the last 8 years.Why are you using no hands? That seems like you're just asking for trouble, especially with no safety bars there. And creatine is pretty much useful for everyoneRespect the thin man, fear the thin man.A beer is not going to hurt you,  he'll even two won't.  I'm not talking trashed 10 beers in. It's complex cards. And unless your a pro athlete what the Fuck lol. 

I played high level university hockey. We had beers. Sounds like bro speak that you can't drink and have abs. You are certainly mistaken. Should have said something.Do you take turns in between rest times? I'm assuming that's how it works, right?http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/indexYeah everyone knows what it is... That's the jokeDid you tell them?Well I don't know about you, but I certainly don't get drunk from 2 beers.Just from what i have seen. From college gyms to ymca's to la fitness...i see more men in the gym than women. I have never been to a crossfit gym so i cannot say anything about that. You can't undo the past.

Just go back to following your program until it's time to cut for real.
My end goal is around 200-220lb at about 7-9% bodyfat. I weigh myself a few times through the week to make sure I am putting it on.Double pillows helped me slightly with this. But yeah, it's very common.100g of chicken breast is more like 20-25g than 40gI don't know, just something about tying two pieces usable of gym equipment together to make one for yourself and effectively denying everyone else the use of a rope. This guy did it at peak hour on a Monday so that made it worse, I guess. Like I said, good luck.And you know this because you're fat? Have you ever been fat? No you're just a skinny runt who thinks they know what you clearly don't. Nothing but mindless drivel from you. You're like a virgin telling me what sex is like. This is skinny logic.

By your absurd logic then skinny ppl should always be cold because they're pushing their skinny ass bodies around? But skinny ppl aren't always cold, idiot.

Weight loss, in some cases can lead to hypothyroidism and this can lead to feeling cold. Maybe this quote below will help. But I doubt it will enlighten you. That would take comprehension, empathy, and altruism. All of which you clearly lack. So feel to miss the point.

&gt; Dr. Broda Barnes, a pioneering endocrinologist from the last century, was among the first to begin to consider the body temperature as an outward marker for the body’s most basic functioning—cellular metabolism. He noted that patients who presented with the symptoms of a low metabolic rate—lowered thyroid function especially—also generally presented with a lowered body temperature which was typically 97.8 or below. Barnes contended that the body temperature was actually by far the clearest indicator of lowered metabolism and low thyroid function—much clearer in fact, than even blood work and lab results. His work has influenced many physiologists and endocrinologists that followed, and today, it is well-known that body temperature is indeed a biomarker for metabolism and thyroid function.

&gt; What this essentially means, is that a higher body temperature is a reflection of a higher metabolism, while a low body temperature will indicate a low metabolism. It’s critically important, because your metabolism is essentially how well your cells are able to convert fuel to energy. 

&gt; And just about everything in your body needs that energy to function. Everything from your digestive system to your liver and all other vital organs; to your endocrine system and all its critical hormones; to your brain and nervous system—everything relies on how well your cells produce energy.

&gt; So when your metabolism is low? You’ll start to see symptoms like these:

&gt; * Poor digestion and food intolerances
* Constipation or abnormal bowel movements
* Cold hands and feet
* Frequent urination
* Mood swings and instability
* Dry skin and/or skin disorders such as acne and eczema
* Thin, brittle hair and nails
* Sleep problems and insomnia
* Exhaustion and a “wired/tired” energy level cycle
* PMS, infertility, low sex drive and other hormonal imbalances
* Blood sugar crashes and instability
* Susceptibility to illness
* Weight gain, particularly around the midsection
* ***Chronically low body temperature***

&gt; Yes, metabolism means how all of your body’s systems are fueled at the cellular level. It’s a big, huge, really big deal. And it needs to be working properly in order for your body to be in good health. If you’ve got a low body temperature, that’s your first sign that you need to work on improving your metabolism so you can improve overall health and avoid the damage and disorders that can accompany a lowered metabolism.
   

When I was living in Spain I went to a few different gyms across the country. Every single one of them made the users bring a towel (one of those narrow ones that you put between the bench and your body) if they wanted to work out, and they gave you one when you registered and also sold them on the counter, so you had no excuse not to bring one.

I'm now living in UK, and NOBODY in my gym uses towels. Almost nobody wipes the benches out when they are done either. They just go from machine to machine, leaving everything sweaty as hell and soaking in other people's sweat. I find it disgusting, so I just bring the old towels with me.

I still wonder how this towel thing cannot be commonplace everywhere.http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/06/body-image-concerns-men-more-than-women

This was pretty interesting. Does not mean more men go, but surprising to me at least.Exercise is a great tool to help in your battle against depression. I would ask that you read [Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain](http://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain/dp/0316113514) as it will change the way you look at your own depression and treatments that you control, its $3.41 right now. With pills you get sort of a helpless feeling, that is these pills will make me feel better it's out of my control. With exercise you are in control. You decide when you want to exercise and puts you back in the drivers seat. Along with the exercise comes better long term habits from sleeping habits to nutritional habits.If that happened to me, it would give me *soooo* much motivation to hit the gym up harder than ever and show those people what I can do. Sorry man, I hope you have a good day."Eat my friend" =/= "Eat, my friend"

This has been a public service announcement.Not a smoker or anything like that and I don't have a history of respiratory problems either.

I feel completely fine in the vast majority scenarios revolving around cardio and fitness; it's only the HIIT where I'm truly putting in 100% effort that I have any respiratory problem. Is that still consistent with asthma/chronic bronchitis? I know very little about respiratory problems, so obviously my opinion doesn't mean much, but it certainly doesn't feel like I have any larger health issues--just one particular intense scenario that's problematic.

I guess I will stop though, since my cough doesn't seem normal. I was hoping it was more of a symptom of me ramping up my cardio in such an intense fashion, and my body was just taking time to adjust.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFitness) if you have any questions or concerns.*My opinion is that emotion follows motion. The positives of exercising regularly are so great that you have nothing to lose. 

I have struggled with a handful of different prescription medications (more for anxiety than depression in my case) and found the side effects to be far worse than any benefits. The after effects of endorphin release as well as improved sleep from physicality exerting yourself will help your mind and body.

There is a big link between Omega 3 fatty acids and reducing depression and also Probiotics - high quality probiotics such as Bio-K brand are excellent. I would suggest trying to add those 2 supplements to your diet and get to exercising as much as you can. I've recently bought another product called EMP by Truehope. It is a vitamin and mineral blend designed specifically to help with brain health and claims to have great benefits for people with depression, anxiety and other mood disorders. I can't endorse it and give my opinion because I haven't started taking it yet, but it may be something worth looking into.

TL; DR start exercising now, you have everything to gain.  Try some vitamin supplementation to help give your brain and body what it may be deficient in. 

Edit: side effects, not dude effectsCould have just exhausted your self from the heavy lifts or just having an off day, I would try 60 or whatever you fully completed last and work back up I just like to keep it relatively light, like I said I don't like going super heavy all the time. The only thing I'm worried about extending and contracting with good form. I could go a lot heavier if I wanted to.
Ah shit, I forgot about cheat days. The moment I forgot about them was probably the same day I started making real progress.Any number of confounding variables. Changes in daily activity. Changes in daily water intake. Changes in time of weighing.  Even changes in daily temperature will make you sweat more and lose water. 

The whoosh effect is people's attempts to apply a pattern to a huge number of effects that don't have any pattern at all. Nah, way too beta and allergic to confrontation. Also those dudes were all way more jacked than I am. Lol wat&gt;Butt plug

Squat plugDoes your gym offer classes like aerobics, zumba, spin, yoga, etc.?  My old gym did and the sex ratio was pretty balanced, in fact I would guess that there were more women than men.

So it seems to me it depends on what is offered at the gym.  Classes seem most appealing to women; lifting weights, especially with barbells, seems most appealing to men.  I would put things in this order in terms of male/female preference:

Classes (e.g. aerobics, zumba, etc); cardio machines (e.g. treadmill elliptical trainer); calisthenics (e.g. exercises which primarily involve body weight); weight machines (e.g. the kind where you put a pin in a stack of weights); dumbells; barbells. 

I'd be willing to bet most gyms that have a smith machine also have a leg press. And if you have a smith machine, squats would be better, so there's never a case where there's no other options than to lay on your back and press a fixed barbell with your legs.Not to just dive in a defend the almighty rippletits, but Rippetoe has like 30+ years of coaching experience at the national/international level of powerlifting/olympic weight lifting. 

[He is also a former competitive powerlifter](http://i56.tinypic.com/1z5pzxz.jpg)read the article. Of course your body could repair more when only doing 3 sets of one exercises. But if you full exhaust your muscles you're going to need more than 1 rest day. 

http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/3173042

training 3 days per week between two muscle groups. 4 days rest in between.

And also, that article you posted first only pointed out weak arguments for why body building workouts *suck* but it doesn't give a solution. 

Whatever, we could argue all day and night, I think what I outlined for the OP was the most simple and basic form of gym routines, its simple, it works, no need to confuse him with out argument and by posting articles that will overwhelm a reader. 

It's possible that could be the case! I'm just saying I would get it checked by a doc because a 2 day cough and the weird taste just seems off.So how many nipple licks has he got you?There are few crimes that warrant the death penalty. This is one of them.Cause bro, I bench press 1000 lbs but can't go super heavy all the time. So I usually stay at 100 lbs to be safe.

Most of the guys are bullshitting, everyone tries add some extra pounds.You are truly an idiot aren't you? You sound grumpy. I think you need your 7th meal of the day fattie...and some cranbery juice you botch.10/10. Solid gold like this is almost the sole reason why I come here :PBumped into him at Six Flags this summer.  I'm 5'5" -- he's WAAAAAY taller and one of the most beautiful men I've ever seen so needless to say I did the goldfish mouth gulp of shame instead of croaking out the 'hello' I was trying to accomplish and just walked away.  Dude is freakin scary looking in person.  Wasn't sure if I'd get a handshake or an RKO. 

That said, if I ever get lucky enough to run into him again I'm climbing on him like a papoose and nothing or nobody is going to stop me.  :-)

Do you have access to kettlebells? The swing uses the same muscles and can really assist your deadlift. There's multiple people at my gym that do their rows on the rack. Lean right against the rack and block all the dumbbells. Proof of what? I swear my GF is black, her mum can cook with every part of the lemonCanned sardines in Louisiana sauce mixed with broccoli or riceBulk and squat. Bulk and squat. I need to really stop avoiding yoga and stretching. I do tons of cardio and lifting but yoga is something I always procrastinate with. why do you list glutes bridge AND hip thrust? aren't they the same thing?
Your thermodynamics are off. Assuming the same rate of heat transfer through our bodies (and I assume none of my friends/girlfriends are made of anything but meat), I would have to be at a higher internal temperature to be giving off more heat.

The other option is that we have the same core temperatures, and my body is better at conducting heat out of it.

For me to have a cooler internal temp, I would have to be MUCH better at shedding heat than they are, which I don't think is the case, because I also get hot easier.So that's what they call it!Fuck those people, seriously.  Those three are laughing at you for trying but I'm willing to bet those little bastards hardly lift at all.  I'm really sorry this happened to you, op.  

In my experience, the idiots who hardly make any progress are always the ones who will make fun of you.  They know that they'll never amount to anything so it's their little mission to bring as much people as possible down with them.  They're nothing comparing to you, you've got more heart and soul than those miserable bastards.

I also agree that the more experienced guys are much kinder than those fuckers.  I was doing deadlifts one day and a man - who was squatting 300+ pounds at the time - stopped squatting the 300+ pound bar and took the time to help me.  He helped correct my form and movement.  This was while some scrawny guy was giggling at me.

Also, remember that you used to be really fit and you can do it again.  It takes time and persistence (but you already knew that) so you'll be great once again.  I can bench 120 but that took months to achieve.  Keep going at it and you'll be benching 265 like the bad ass that you are!

Sorry for all the cursing but that kind of hate towards others really ruffles my jammies.I used to be really depressed too. I still am sometimes but exercise has gone to great lengths helping me get my confidence up which was a huge factor in my depression. I no longer feel ugly worthless or unwanted. I still wish I looked better but after about 5 weeks of constant lifting I've realized I control all that stuff and its helped me take control (feeling helpless was also a big thing in my depression). Hope this helps. Good luck bud, its an uphill battle but if you can fight it you can do anything (well mostly).For every three steps of inhaling you exhale for two steps.

Right foot – begin inhale

Left foot- continue inhale

Right foot- continue inhale

Left foot- begin exhale

Right foot- continue exhale

Start cycle over. Works for me.You're just a shitty wannabe comedian. You sound like you're 12 years old.  Stop worrying about what other people do in the gym.People need to be feeling my arms more. They don't know what they're missing.The understood rule in my gym is that you aren't using it if you are talking or resting. Anyone can ask nicely to work in between someone else's sets if they put things back for them when done with yours.It seems like you're putting your knees forward, not butt back. Always butt back first "Oy, m8, I'll clip ya right on da chin ya bastard."It depends on what kind or squat form you're using. If you're doing Olympic style lifts you will be going straight up and down, so, theoretically, the smith machine should be fine. However, if you're doing low-bar squats there is slight movement to the bar's path (not much, but it is different).Dude that editing is so flawless.  I actually thought Randy Orton actually RKO'D that lady crushing the grapes.You sir, are a genius!That much milk causes acne on meNo, but looking online it appears that I can do that with dumbbells as well (like Goblet squats can be done with both). I'll be sure to try that out, thank you![Just gotta give him a "Psh".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5c57rSIPyY)Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

Read the FAQof the framed pic bruhWeight loss will follow your calorie consumption and calorie expenditure, but there is a lot of noise on the trend lines. Yes, bill will progress faster *until he has to cut*. At that point Al will make up ground. Hate the smith, you can only progress so far on it. Have one, but getting a proper squat and bench rack soon!I will, from this moment onward until the stars burn cold, call the golf cart back seat the "tail gunner seat". Magnificent.So in the analogy you just set up, meth is creatine? Beyond being ridiculous, that analogy just proves my point...the SF 49ers work out their choreo at my gym studio. luckily the squat rack is right next to the window pane of the studio. heavy lifts with extended rest periods was the natural choice that day Correct me if I am wrong but I think this is the case fore a low bar squat and in a highbar squat the knees are supposed to travel forward.I like to do single leg presses. Do you see men doing less than their body weight? One thought I had is that they have bad knees / back so they do leg presses instead, but can't do much weight because their legs aren't very strong. This is how my buddy started, he fucked his back in the army. I think he's up to about 5 plates now.Your muscles burn far more calories than fat. So if you build more muscles you will burn more fat. In another universe - a shy guy reads about how he should work out to improve himself. Very introverted he puts on sports clothes that still hid lots of his body as he doesn't like how he looks. He wears a hoodie to avoid looking at people all around the gym who he fears will be looking, pointing and laughing at him. He wears headphones for the same reason.

He's spent some time on the internet and knows that lifting is one of the best things he can do to improve himself, but he's also read that many noobs try to start with too much weight and injure himself.

So he goes into the gym, and quietly does the best exercise he knows, and being totally afraid of asking one of the laughing meat heads in the gym for help, he quickly and quietly finishes his workout and gets out before he feels completely humiliated.

## [Rule 5: Asking for medical or injury advice is not allowed](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_5._asking_for_medical_or_injury_advice_is_not_allowed)

&gt;If you're sick, hurt, or injured you should be getting help and/or advice somewhere else - preferably from a doctor. While people in Fittit might have similar conditions as you, not a single person will be able to examine you personally or understand your specific situation, and it's very hard to validate credentials over the internet. You should instead find a professional with proper schooling and experience who can examine and treat you in person. General Practitioners might not be the best for sports-related issues, so it is recommended that you find a Sports Medicine doctor or a Physical Therapist.

&gt;Prohibited topics include, but are not limited to: training advice with a known medical condition; training advice specifically involving an injured body part; and "general experience" posts asking about other people's experiences with a particular injury.  Posts on these topics are considered requests for medical/injury advice and are not allowed.  Posts seeking training advice that *excludes* an injured body part are allowed.

&gt;If you would like help identifying or correcting a painful movement, consider posting a [form check]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_2._how_to_post_a_form_check).

I don't want to be that "Don't trust the system" guy but this needs to be said. There are a large number of doctors and healthcare providers who get paid off by pharmaceutical companies ( including the ones that make prozac, fluoxetine, etc...). Although more recent studies have shown that serotinin have very little correlation with symptoms of depression, these SSRI's are still widely prescribed.

I have suffered from what different pschiatrists and psychologists call "clinical depression" for 5 years, which I now view as deep rooted discontent in ones life that companies can make money off of. I don't believe in clinical depression, but that doesn't mean I don't believe all of the symptoms aren't real because I know damn well how horrible they can be. But these symptoms aren't a chemical imbalance in your brain, I believe it's your minds way of helping bringing unwanted thoughts and emotions to the surface. The only way you can improve yourself is to be honest with yourself and analyze these thoughts and emotions. I would like to make a note here that many people ( including myself) who have suffered from symptoms of depressions can easily get stuck into what I call an infinite loop. Theres is another term for it which I can't think of off hand, but it is basically the constant burden of bad thoughts. I bring this up because I think therapists are a very experienced and underutilized resource for helping you analyze your own emotions in way that is constructive, not self destructive.

And now I just realized that I haven't adressed your question, but my answer is an outstanding yes. Getting myself into a routine of going to the gym 5 days a week has been one of the best decisions I have made. Endorphins are a great thing, but fitness has had a much greater impact on my life than just an endorphin. One of the main aspects is self-confidence and I'm not only talking about being comfortable with your own body, although I think that is also important. With self-confidence comes the realization that YOU are in control of your own life and nobody or anything else. Don't rely on a pill that dulls not just the sadness, but the positive emotions as well. 

Oh and one last thing; it's not always easy to get out of bed and go to the gym. Even after going to the gym for close to 6 months I still have my bad days where I think negativley and don't want to go the the gym. You just gotta say fuck it and make your body move despite what your mind is telling you because once you get to the gym and start working out, your mind will start feeding off of your body's hapiness :) Leg press is designed to prepare your body and CNS for squats. It seems odd but some people just don't have enough strength to do body squats. My aunt was one of those people (5'5" ~110lbs, 50 years old). She worked with an empty sled until she was able to lift a little past body weight. After that she moved to body squats, and then added the bar.This submission has been removed.

Lifting heavy things is the only thing that brings me anywhere near close to happy. 

Its still not enough on its own, though.Don't see a trainer - see a physiotherapist next time.provided theyre both 500 over their maintenance weight, theyll both progress at the same pace. Theres no need for more than 500 over unless you're on gear, its more there as a buffer because it is better to go over than under&gt; I can't see where she came up with the whole"workout only an hour and a half a week". 

Right here:

&gt; God she's dumbWas squatting yesterday and I moved my hands wider and somehow ended up with a metal sliver from the barbell. Had to go to the hospital to get it taken out which resulted in the doctor cutting through my callus for ten minutes. Long story short I can't lift for a week and it's killin meYeah. One rests while one lifts. I don't like to do it since I like to time my rests and other guys always seem to be on different schedules That's exactly how I fucked up my shoulders. This is a stupid question. You are probably a novice at best and you're talking about giving up coffee so you can absorb an extra 3 micrograms of protein. Reevaluate your life.First up; I'm so sorry for your loss. Nothing can make it easier except time, believe me it will get easier to cope with, lost my Dad when I was 24, the first year is the hardest. You're doing the right thing, hold your head up and keep coming back to the gym. Keep struggling for those reps!

Initial response to reading this is that I wanted to slap those women, but in reality if I was there I'd like to think I'd say this to them; "Strong people don't put others down, they lift them up". Women like that make me ashamed to be a woman. I can't stand how they can get so catty, I've been on the receiving end of it myself recently in my gym and it made me want to quit, I try not to let them in my head but it's hard.

I don't have very much bodyfat and I'm strong (though not as big as I want to be) yet I get lazy and slack off so whenever I see people struggling to get reps out or going hard with extra weight to lose I just think they're inspirational, I never think I'm better than them. I wish everyone could leave ego at the gym door but fact is a lot of people bring massive egos/bravado to the weight room. But dude, you're getting stronger each time you struggle for a rep. Keep it up and you're going to end up with a great physique! Besides, rest assured you're already a far more worthwhile person than either of them, you have got something neither of those women have: compassion and awareness. Don't let horrible people drag you down. Don't even notice them when you walk in the gym. Keep it up, you're on the right track and every drop of sweat and aching muscle is worth it.No I'm using meth as a basis for an experiment that I conducted but nobody else has. Obviously you didn't seem to understand that. Let me break it down barney style for you. CREATINE IS NOT PROVEN TO CAUSE HAIR LOSS. THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF THIS OCCURRING. DOEST THOU UNDERSTANDETH?One of them is 500 over and one is 1000 over. I have a video of me benching 300 (touch and go) and an old video of 345 x 5 squats. (On the squats I should have gone a bit lower). I also have a video of me benchin 275 with ease. Would you like to see? It's probably even, but a lot of women go to women's only gyms.Not particularly negative.. I actually noticed everyone there talks to each other but not me (aside from a few peeps).. So it was funny/cool to me
That feeling going home from the gym. Love it. &gt; it is purely a chemical imbalance thing.

So show me the studies that say that working out strenuously generates in your brain the chemicals that the antidepressants replaces.

I start my squat warm-ups at just the bar, which feel something like a toothpick to me. But then I figure most people there wouldn't be in a place to judge me because I've either never seen them lift legs in the 8 months I've been going or worse, I have seen them lift legs. 

Whatevs. I'll just do me.He came to my golds one time. He kept his vape pen in his bag and was smoking the whole time in between sets.

Fucking badassI would add in that women also use beauty products such as makeup, hair dye and hair products more than men do in pursuit of their ideal look. I think men rely more on having a muscular body and hair grooming which may be the reason men spend proportionally more time in the gym. So at 24hr fitness (this is the second time this has happened), I was just doing my thing. I usually don't talk to anyone because I don't wanna waste their/my time, etc. 

Was squatting. 3rd set. Was a bit tired so I let out bit of a grunt on my last rep. A dude that was walking by (2nd time seeing him, first time encounter was about the same) stops, looks at my last rep. As I unrack to take a break asks me "Why you go so low? that's bad for your knees". 

I replied well that's the way I learned. So after my break, I got back on for my 4th set. The dude stayed and watched me. After the set, he says "you should lift in chucks. Get yourself some real shoes. You look broke". I gave him a shrug and he left so I was like okay what a weird day. I do 5th set, finish up on squat so I proceed to deadlift. 

After my first set, he comes back from somewhere, and says "why are you dropping weights on the floor all loud and SH!T! You think you own this place or something?" 

....needless to say, I was baffled. Went to the gym for leg gains; ended up with patience gains.I'm glad you shat in there shower. I'd have done the same thing, laugh that one off bitch!Loooool, gotchya, is it aight if I do it on Tuesday, I'm at interviews Sunday and Mondayyou are technically drunk. As you have alcohol in your system. maybe semantics here. What i meant was I have a beer, or 2 or 3 if its a weekend while i cook. But I am certainly not trashed. and 3-4 beers aint goin hurt ya if your lifting, running etc. And if you think its going to hurt your gainz&gt; LMFAOSo you're saying meth is "not proven" to be addictive..? Makes no sense. Creatine has been *linked* to hair loss. I'm not saying that means people shouldn't take creatine. I take creatine myself every day. My point is that if someone starts taking creatine and notices signs of hair loss after a few weeks, they should decide for themselves if it's worth continuing or not.

Just because A isn't *proven* to cause B, doesn't mean that it isn't the case. I'm not saying to assume creatine causes hairloss, but given that there's significant anecdotal evidence that backs me up (for some people) I think it's worth thinking about carefully.

If you think that creatine 100% does not contribute to hair loss for anybody just because nobody has conducted a controlled double-blind study on it yet, that's just foolish.Almost got me there. These never get old. I take espresso shots at the rate heavy smokers take smoke breaksThis is why coffee is essential to your pre workoutThanks man. I really do try to stay positive but buttholes like that are the reason I quit going to the gym when I was younger.  

I already said I don't care about strength,  then some bitter person comes and tries to say I'm making stuff up when I have no reason to lie to y'all. This submission has been removed.

Sooo.. Free legs?9 cups is nothing.... I sleep on redbukl3 days on, 1 day rest, 3 days on...and so on. That would be 5/6 days a week.I don't lift the biggest at my gym but I don't skip leg days, lots of 'curl bros' who don't seem to have a good balance though. You know, one of the things I'm happiest and most fortunate to have happen to me was joining kayaking on a whim. It opened my eyes to both cardio and strength, team sport and the outdoors. I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun sport to pick up (Dragon boating, rowing and canoeing are all options with similar traits - I did 4-man flatwater for a couple years).

Some little things you can do to get yourself moving :
It takes time. Commit yourself for no less than two months to form the habits - count calories, drink lots of water and make a habit out of getting exercise. There are many great exercise routines posted in the wiki for beginners - do something for strength, and look for a fun cardio activity like badminton, swimming or running (ugh). If I had to pick one, though, it would be a mix of conventional strength training and bodyweight strength - chin ups and pushups on to progressions like front levers, flags and planches. I'm giving myself a year to get a planche right now. It's very fun, requires little equipment and is great for overall strength and mobility development.

Nobody thinks anybody is a loser in the gym for being weak or slow. If you lift frequently the thing that will strike you most is how much you, yourself, have to work on.

Take it step by step and don't push too hard. You will see remarkable improvement in the very beginning, don't get carried away and hurt yourself. This is especially true for calisthenics which tend to strain the elbow and shoulder joints . 

PM me if you want to chat about this stuff! I'm rooting for you :)That sounds great. My gym plays the shittiest music so I would love that. This past chest day I was doing some dumbbell presses on a flat bench. I was at my final and heaviest set, pumping myself up, my music gets close to the drop so I knee those dumbbells up in the air and start laying back... and I landed a little too hard and an ass shaking fart ripped it's way out of me. 

I finished the set. For shrugs it doesn't really matter much, since the target is the traps which control movement up and down for the shoulder. Too much rolling is bad for the joint, so while you might not activate the traps as hard as with a free bar, I'd say it's pretty equivalent. 

For calves, it's probably mostly a safety thing. I have trouble balancing when I load up on calves so I do them in a smith as well. When you're standing on just your toes, and bringing your calves lower than the platform you're on, I don't want to have to worry about falling backwards/forwards. 1600 on days I work our 1300 on days I don't 
I'm 25 f 157lbs about 5 foot 8.5 inches trying to lose around 20 lbs and tone I'm seeing my trainer once a weekEveryone that believes they have a high metabolism realizes that their metabolism ain't that high the moment they start counting calories.I worked out with a friend today.  I got to the gym at our work a few minutes early.  I go over to check out a cool military vehicle while I wait and there was a sheet of ice you could skate on behind it (it was about 50 degrees outside, but it was in the shade and it has been cold).  Anyway, like a cartoon character I run in place trying to keep my balance and fall flat on my butt.  I fell two more times trying to get up.  I am sure the guards love this tape.

Workout was good though, Chest and Back!I'm in the early phases of starting a food company called [Statfoods](http://www.statfoods.com).

I used to breath through my nose while jogging and it screwed me up, couldn't jog more than 10 mins. I use my mouth now, been very effective,That really sucks and I'm sorry that happened to you. It says so much about the two girls- who shames someone who is working hard to better themselves? Especially an employee whose job is to make the environment welcoming and safe. 

I worked at a pool and was friends with the gym employees and never saw anything like that happen, and I'm sure if it did they would be "talked to" immediately. 

You shouldn't feel embarrassed. Those two girls should feel embarrassed for being sad and insecure enough to feel the need to put down someone else's efforts. Keep on keepin onIt was a hypothetical scenario... Creatine does not cause hair loss...  http://www.schwarzenegger.com/fitness/post/common-creatine-questions-and-answers Okay, gotcha. That makes more sense.Try to get out and do something productive, whether it's sitting outside, creating a city on sim city, or whatever. Just do something in the few waking hours you have. It helps tremendously with the mental aspect of recovery. 

I had a concussion the other week, so I was stuck in my room with the lights off. All I could do was sleep and take Tylenol. For the first week, getting my heart rate up gave me pounding headaches. The second week I got really depressed. This wasn't woe as me I can't work out sadness. I literally began spiraling into the darkest place I have ever been. Then, I realized that I hadn't been outside or walked further than to the bathroom from my bed. I waited until it was dark out, since the sun gave me headaches, and I went on a slow, easy walk. 

The goal wasn't to get exercise, but to be outside. My tiny dorm room was destroying my mind. That walk didn't fix everything, but damn did I feel better about having done nothing all day. As i already said alternating between that and GVT wont IMHO give the best results. The body always trys to adapt to the current activities. So, sure you gonna have/see results when you adapt to high volume or high frequency but you can´t really progress in weights/reps etc. which will lead to a reliable progression and result. 
e.g. the first weeks of GVT you will just have a hard time adapting to that high volumen, on the other side switching after that will have a long time of adaption to which wont benefit into the succes of your strenght programm. 

IMO switch between Texas Method/Madcows/ 5/3/1 to a 5x5 volume accessiory work oriented routine. Maybe switch some movements to alternatives Squats/Front Squats, deadlift/SL deadlift/sumo, bench/incline/dumbbell, press/standing dumbbell OHP, that will give another stimulus and could benefit your main movements.

Thats what i do, i am now in my deload week. I am now like you thinking about what to do next. But i think i do another 5/3/1 circle..thanks very much for that... i was actually looking for advice relevant to my specific situation. That's about the stupidest asshole comment I've ever read. None of what you said is relative to why anyone would go low weight high rep. there is a mom/daughter duo who are sometimes at my gym the same time I'm there. Small gym and they work out pretty hard so I've talked to them from time to time. 

There are these pylo boxes everyone puts their crap on and mom and daughter are standing by them. I'm finishing my workout with some feet elevated pushups so ask them to move. I start cranking out PU and the daughter is like "Can I get on your back? I'm like 140."

Your boy happily agrees and cranks out a set of ten. It's just a research chemical company selling possibly dubious roids.  Who cares.As a 28 male with a nice booty, lunges and leg curls worked for me.Oberyn looking boy almost lost his shit on the treadmill when he dropped my phone, I'm over here having flashbacks.only thing girls notice about me, love the attention though.

And the OP always talks about how they finish their set before going to the bathroom.  I would hate that person if I was working out next to them that's just disgusting.  "Done doing my half-assed single squat with 5 catties on each end. Better leave them here for the next person!"Do you have any recommendations for dynamic warmups I can do before I lift? I realized after thinking about it just now that I know dynamic warmups are better, but I'm still just static stretching but I don't know a good dynamic warmup. I'm doing Madcow right now, so I'd be warming up for the standard compound barbell exercises.

I already do arm circles which I believe are dynamic, and they seem good for my shoulders, but I don't know what to do to warm up for squats/deadlift/rows besides bodyweight squats or something.you can melt them down and use the metals for other thingsLol, that made me chuckle One guy. 2x10kg dumbbells, 2x20kg dumbbells, 1x20kg kettle bell, 1x ez-curl bar, 1xbarbell.

"Are you using those 20s?"
   "Yes"
"Do you mind if I grab the ez-curl then?"
   "I'm using that too"

I damn near clubbed him to death with the kettle bell. Sometimes I hate people.So what i want to tell you is that you could possibly waste many weeks just spending the time to adapt to different workout styles!I think it was 85+.You can do it buddy. Have faith in yourself! Eh, it's genetics and juice with that guy. I knew him growing up and he was naturally big in jr high (whole family was pro wrestlers), then he blew up once he started juicing.Why do people do this. Gym by my place has this and EVERYONE does it. 

Guys bring in their friends who have probably never set foot in a gym in their lives and they show them this. I'm seriously afraid someone is just gonna fall right on their ass and the weight will break their back or something.Eat more. Last gym I was at before switching had a smith but no leg press. I did squats but that just wasnt enough. I made do and used it as a leg press. Better than using a free bar.From that page:

&gt; There is some evidence that suggests creatine can raise your dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. DHT is linked to an increase in hair loss characterized by a receding hairline (not the hair loss that starts at the back of the head).

&gt; The most sensible conclusion is that if you are balding, taking creatine may *slightly* accelerate hair loss. It is highly unlikely that creatine itself will cause hair loss.

Notice they use the same words I've been using (some evidence, linked, etc.). That's pretty much my point exactly... Although I'd disagree with the phrasing of "slightly accelerate" given what I've heard from others on this subreddit.[Yourepeat](http://cdn.yourepeat.com/media/gif/001/588/041/cd4834c66c8be6d3ea202a1e31092c99.gif)[Yourepeat](http://cdn.yourepeat.com/media/gif/001/588/041/cd4834c66c8be6d3ea202a1e31092c99.gif)Smith machines are fine, just use them in moderation. Try and incorporate different things, **that work for you**, into your routine. Don't just get stuck on one routine/exercise/piece of equipment. Follow this and, generally speaking, most of the pieces of equipment you find in a gym will have something unique to offer you. I always thought this was common sense. Then when my brother and I joined our gym we quickly found out we're the only ones. We're the only ones that lay a towel down and wipe down when we're done. Seriously people look at us like "why?" And I'm like "because staph sucks is why"You have 2 choices. You either workout after you drink pre-workout. Or you fucking explode. Losing the weight was more nutrition. The fitness I gained was from the Muay Thai/kick boxing. In my opinion if you have the time and you want the results you should being attacking your goal from multiple angles. The hour classes I was doing burned anywhere from 600 to 900 calories. They definitely helped hahaThat comic is a lie. Their butts are never that shinyandidontknowwhyimpointingthatoutGod I wanna sit on that guy's face It is highly unlikely that creatine itself will cause hair loss. &lt;--- da fuq do you think this is m8. I don't agree with this article either. There's no substantial proof that it causes it. Where in there did it say it causes it? It doesn't.I've never come across any type of study showing the relative benefits of different amounts of caloric surpluses.

Experience said its diminishing returns. The +1000 guy would probably make more progress before plateauing than the +500 guy, but he'd also get pretty fat.Hack squatsYou think thats weird? I DO FARMERS WALKS *insert insanity wolf*Did dom say this? I read that in his voice.
This. I always use a bench and a bar. If I'm going to stand I just go for the tri extension with a single dumbbell.And unless you're planning on making a killing selling workout DVDs, always dump CHA.it's not.One of the facts that I retained from my psych minor was that they were roughly equal in their effect on depression.Do what you can. What is your alternative? Not work out? Keep pumping weight. You won't get a huge chest, but  a tight corded chest is pretty awesome too.At that age just eat.  Don't worry about it unless you start putting on access fat.NSFL FTFYThe people on this subreddit are not the ones who make fun of people at the gym.Don't let that stop you. You are the captain of your own journey that is life. Don't let anything get in your way of you becoming the best man that you can be. Sure it might be a shitty 20 minutes, but like Arnold Schwarzenegger once said "never give up". If you persevere and always try your hardest, you may even become the greatest rower of all time. But to get there first you need to get off your ass and *try*Got any source to this 500 ceiling?This older guy was using the showers and had the curtain opened completely. He was literally standing 2 feet outside the shower with the sprayer head pointed at him while he showered halfway out of the stall. he was kind of standing [like this](http://www.mstrust.org.uk/images/posture-dont-stand-p8-450.png)...gross.Think of carbohydrates as an enzyme for absorbing the protein's amino acids.I could lick a hundred nipples. "Uhhh, it's a balance thing bro. I did that on purpose."Haha this is my favorite storyThere is nothing you can do in a week that's going to make a noticeable difference in how you look.If you go back and read my posts, I never said that creatine by itself causes hair loss. I don't believe creatine by itself causes hair loss. The point I'm trying to make it that creatine is likely linked to increased hair loss in people who are genetically predisposed to it. The article you linked to says that, as does the examine.com article originally posted.This submission has been removed.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFitness) if you have any questions or concerns.*Found out this week that one of the friendly looking regulars at my gym is actually unemployed. I've noticed he spends several hours there each(?) morning and while doing his own drawn out workout he'll take breaks to be a spotter and chat with people and be an all round nice gym guy to lots of the members. I wish him all the best with the job search but I reckon folks will miss the time he gives them when he gets work.Sorry, I'm not a Reddit directory.Is there like a "fitness news" subreddit or something like that? I assumed that would be in the category of /r/fitness, sorry if I was mistaken.Well I'd say to properly fix it probably less than a month but I think this was the only issue that caused my apt, whilst others may have multiple muscle weaknesses/tightenings that are causing the issue.This happened two weeks ago, just keep forgetting to post- Well for the past 3.5 months I have been working out, I used to do it with a partner who got me on track. Well, whenever he couldn't go to the Y I would go to our beach clubs gym. Every time I went I saw this guy who looked like my best friend when I was 10. Let's call him jim. Well jim is like 5 years older then me, we used to live next to each other when we were younger. Naturally being neighbors we became friends, and he was my only friend (he was my best friend, I was probably just the little fat kid he took under his wing). Well sadly my workout partner had a huge schedule change and worked till 10 every day. So I go to the beach club gym by myself now instead of Y (just nicer). One day the card reader is dead so we sign in with paper and I see jims name on the paper. SIDE NOTE jim got ripped and was like 23 now. So I finally go up to him and say hi, he doesn't recognize me and I tell him my name. When I do he litarlly takes a step back and opens his mouth in shock. He and I talk abouse life and all the good memories we had while working out. He gives me pointers on my squats and even showed me this leg workout he did in college baseball. He also told me I looked great and was amazed when I told him I lost 30 pounds. Now I have a friend when I
 workout!

TLDR: meet ripped  best friend and he helps me.

NOTE: We moved away house wise and just lost touch because of age. That is why I dident recognize him earlier
http://www.askmen.com/top_10/fitness/top-10-causes-of-hair-loss.html One last troll article... You mad bro? Man ya'll take this way to serious sometimes ahahaha. But in all seriousness.. Shit like "likely linked" and "may" and "perhaps" Is all theoretical bullshit that they use to cover their ass. Granted it does increase DHT but an increased DHT level does not necessarily mean hair loss. DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOOT M8?!Stronglifts is 5x5 correct? 

How heavy are you currently going? I'm doing SS which is 3x5 and I'm taking upwards of 5 minute rests in between squat sets as i'm currently in uncharted 5 rep pr territory. This puts my workouts around 1 hour.

A nice program to go along with SL or SS is the chin up project. You can find it on T-nation. I would have completely lost it (laughing).bumper plates

I can now squat 135 and I can bench 95. For the record this was my first week lifting.Look up Olympic power lifts exercises. No you are still making noob gainz, if you are progressing linearly and haven't hit your plaeteu keep going.
  
Are you doing your warm ups properly? Are u eating enough?Do it for the naked man&gt; There is this idea that body weight is some how better or safer than using free weights, but I have not found any evidence to support the idea

Goes both ways. It's just opinions and preferences as far as I can tell - no hard evidence to say lifting weights is safe either.I thought it was that one as well.Well I have lost my 2 pack....

And any good way to lose fat with hour going out and running or going to gym? Because I'm socially awkward and do my workouts inside   chin-up push ups Not all possible studies have been made yet and not all studies are easily available.

Furthermore, you're excluding the possibility of other combinations of chemicals or the existence of better chemicals than what is normally present.

Now, I enjoy good science, but your example is too simple to cover all possibilities.I finally have a word for it.Jesus fucking christ, the attitude of some of you is amazing. You know your speaking to a person right? I'm in my final year of my degree, I'm going to have interviews to do my PGCE to be a high school teacher in the UK next week so please don't tell me to         re-evaluate my life. I also go to the gym three times a week and I drink coffee, it makes me shit way more (three shits this morning) and it wouldn't be that much if a crazy idea that if its literally going through me its not being digested properly.

Fucking hell, it was a simple question that hadn't been asked before that I wanted some advice on. None of you posted any evidence to the contrary yet feel completely free to tell me (in so many words) that I'm a fucking idiot. 

I think you'll find it may be you lot that need to 're-evaluate' something.This submission has been removed.

Leg press does not prepare you to squat. I once thought I had mono for a whole year. Turns out, I was just really bored. HI Real - - Sure - he is a great lifter in Olympic technique/style lifting - but his total best lifts for Snatch &amp; Clean/Jerk are significantly under that of 'Oly standards' of guys his weight.  - Cheers bro!For me, no.  I went off for a few months and slowly spiraled (largely unaware myself how much) downward despite exercising 5-6 days a week for 2-3 hours each day (depending on if I did cardio + weights or one or the other). I've been back on them for about a month now and realize that I had forgotten how good I could feel.I was at the gym this morning and saw a girl who looked exactly like my ex from the side. I felt pain, not in my legs from the squats I was doing... but in my heart from the emotions I was feeling. NOONE MAKES ME FEEL MY OWN FEELINGS, NOONE!I thought that meant per one step, you breathe in 3 times and exhale once. Which sounded like a *lot* of breathing. 

But this is usually what I do. 3 steps for breathing in, 2 steps to breathe out. Or if I'm more relaxed, then 4:3. Go to the FAQ look up a program using the program picker. Most of those work outs have spreadsheets and such already where you can plug in numbers to tell you exactly what to do.The idea of anyone doing any exercise with the bumper plates that doesn't touch the ground cheeses me off. Even the football players at my school will squat with them o_Owhy not go to bodybuilding.com and look at the top creatine monohydrate products?was beating the hell out of the heavy bag, gym bros are doing squats about 20 feet away, I was really laying into the bag too and had my headphones in.  Hear one guy yell over my loud music: "Get 'em Rocky!"I heard that bodybuilding usually had overpriced supplements, i'll check it though! thankshttp://m.wikihow.com/Calculate-Work
  
Laws or physics tells us you are indeed doing more "work" when you jump rope.
  
Source: Physics.It's mind to muscle brooooooooooo
Really squeeze your triceps and focus on them.
Also, you should look up proper form cuz ur probably fuckin up
Why do you warm up so low? I start at 225 and end at like 315I appreciate the advice, but that wasn't the question.If your goal is to have a six pack eventually, not doing workouts for your core just because you still have fat on your stomach is completely senseless. There is no reason not to start immediately.Cheaper than GNC.. All that matters to meI can't always make the gym each day so I combine movements a lot. Either push pull days or lower upper as a focus. I also hit my weak areas such as legs and shoulders multiple times a week.Man, I feel bad about this one only because I don't think I handled it right...

So I go to start with my routine with squats when I look around the back of the rack to find the clips are missing. I look around wondering where they could be only to find someone's clipped their plates on the smith machine... Now I know gym policies vary, but I know for a fact my gym does not require the bar be clipped on the smith machine. I take the clips back for my squats, my rationale being its the day after the big snow and the gym is packed. I neither want to lose my chance at the rack nor do I want to inconvenience other people's use of any of the machines or racks. The guy returned and asked where the clips were. I explained I needed them for the squat rack and, because its a smith machine, it doesn't need them. He told me I could find clips elsewhere in the gym, but I wasn't going to fuck someone else's day up that way. I just popped my headphones back on and he shook his head and went back to his routine. He was civil about it in the end, but damn it if I didn't get the stink eye from him for the next hour I spent there on my routine.

Some guy at my gym had roid rage and chucked a 45 lb dumbbell straight into a mirror from a distance of like 15-20 feet. He did crossfit so it could of just been part of his routine.Just focus on compound lifts, if you want to see your abs eat at a caloric deficit aka below your tdee Short answer: yes, bodyweight squats could be more efficient.

Unless you're interested in weights, you would be fine. You could find out how much you're squatting when doing a bodyweight exercise, but it's easier to have an exact number from the leg machine.
For example: body weight - leg weight = squat weight
As compared to: "oh look, 300lbs"Its ok. There will always be somebody willing to pick up the slack when life happens.It's really going to depend a lot on where you need the most work. I'll give you a list of things to look up, and you can sort of pick a few that you like and go from there. I generally do like 2-3 upper body and 2-3 lower body.

Your comment doesn't even begin to answer his question.You need to check out r/bodyweightfitnessI thought so. I'm pretty close to my goal for this cut, I was wondering if I was wasting my time/effort.Oh come on, you can't squat without your glutes. Stop doing all the bs exercises and come back here when you squat 405 for reps. Your butt won't be small.

And no you don't have to feel the muscle when you do an exercise.I have been really struggling with self confidence lately and letting all the ego trippers in my head, feel puny, felt like quitting, been off diet, decided to put off competing (bodybuilding) for 9 months mainly coz I feel like a massive headcase and want more size before I step on stage. Had a training session yesterday (my Saturday) and spent half of it sitting my my trainers office just spewing out my shit to him. 

Was scared he'd be looking at me sideways like I am a crazy bitch but the Dude is amazing; said he really wants to help me, going to hook me up some free sessions coz it was my birthday friday, finding me a training partner to keep my focus (I'm a bit shy and haven't really made any close gym friends, most the other female bodybuilders, and there aren't many at my gym, are all really out there personalities) He gave me a peptalk that made me realize how much he believes in me and I can't even begin to put into words what that means. Also he gave me hugs, can't articulate what that did for me either. Then we hit legs, not hard but still enough to get them screaming.

Heading back in to the gym today coz of yesterdays session.

Feels good man.

My trainer is gold.Hi vgn - Your program / routine sounds great - ! I 100% agree with your flex/stretch/roll focus - it really helps me ensure a stronger training session with minimal option of injury and quicker recovery. 

I 'hated' stretching as much as anyone; but my credo is now ABS - Always Be Stretching! Develop your fave stretches - become an expert at them and do them whenever you can - waiting for kettle to boil, computer to load, waiting in a queue, whenever you stand up from sitting etc 

And yes - compound bodyweight really puts YOU in control of every aspect of your body!

Cheers bro!Try Tabata and/or HIIT workout!

Also use some Creatine Monohydrate (5 Grams a day). And maybe some Whey Protein or BCAA's. I would also consume 1 Gram of EPA/DHA (Fish Oil) daily.

This is what I would do. If you eat more you should hit your plaeteu later than some eating less than you in theory.Thanks bro. 4 x 8-12 fluorescent bulbs helps a lot. I do try to take pics in the exact same spot now though. To keep the lights consistentI don't get the balls thing, yeah I pat my crotch after a shower with a towel but it doesn't need to be bone dry. What's with old guys and drying their sac?What I find helpful is to really focus on squatting down and pushing my knees outwards in line with my feet as opposed to sitting back and having your knees push forward. Pretend like you're squatting down to T-bag someone directly below your ball sack.I was doing concentration curls with a 35 lb dumbbell making sure I was getting full ROM. Suddenly, while mid curl, I over hear these 2 high school kids next to me talk about how they're stoked they can curl more weight than me. I peep the weight they were lifting which happened to be an 80 pound straight bar, and the best part was that they were barely lowering the bar yet swinging their bodies to use their momentum, doing the most pathetic curls ever. If I would have grabbed a giant protractor and measured the angle of their arms as they curled, the angles would have measured no more than 30 degrees. I just ignored their rubbish and continued blasting my reps.I work out at a gym where the squat racks face each other. There's 8 racks in a line of 4 pairs so people often do more than just squats. Anyways, I'm doing squats and directly in front of me is a hot girl doing pull ups. This girl is in the gym all the time and takes her lifting pretty seriously. So were facing each other doing our respective exercises, when we both look in the mirrors behind one another(I could partially see around her torso) at the same time only to realize that in the mirror, the placement of our bodies look pretty sexual, as if I'm eating her out. We both laughed and continued our workoutsIt's a leg exercise, so I don't want to cheat and use my hands.Well after 1 year I'm squatting 335 and deadlifting 455 at 165bw, so I'm well on my way to your made up man-limit of 405.  Fuck me for wanting to improve my form though, right?Fuck those worthless cunts. Don't compare yourself with anyone else; just know that you're doing something good for yourself and you're doing the best you can. What? Are you recommending him to do 100 crunches a day or something?
  
For abs it's all mainly diet then exercise. But go ahead do your crunches let's see how these "ab" exercises can get you.You could try supplements too! Like L-Tyrosine and FIsh Oil.As a woman: you really shouldn't be embarassed for making changes for the better- they should be embarassed for their behaviour!

My gym doesn't have full racks. Yeah, I had a feeling that those lifts were what were implied however I don't bench press or deadlift. Is there much of an advantage of bench press over dumbbell press?

Thank you so much for all the advice! I'll definitely be taking it all into consideration. :)

The answer your looking for is don't op, if you still have no done or are in progress of noob gains "ab" exercises will not benefit you at all.This is what I take, its 100% creatine monohydrate 1 tsp = 5 grams. I usually take 5 grams in the morning by simply putting it in my mouth and washing it down with water. Brand isn't a huge deal with creatine, as long as its monohydrate and cheap it should be fine.Went to a commercial gym for the first time in ever. Went to grab some water in the bathroom - a dude was taking a massive dump next door. Hands down I thought he was dying in there. It sounded like something out of this world.There's one of these guys at my gym. I actually think he might just sell roids... I've only ever seen him work arms and it shows in his body, and considering how much he's there, he doesn't look good at all. He also has roid gut, zero definition, and has bursts of singing and raucous laughter. This is not even a coherent story, I know.I don't see anything about where to buy an elliptical cheaply on the FAQ, which is why I made the post.having abs is nice and all but at 6"7 i would be on a serious bulk and lifting heavy, you would be able to put on lots of mass on your frame.Also i don't believe i'm doing paleo as i'm encouraged to have dairy, cheese etc too. It's certainly never been mentioned to me as being what i'm doing...I like how you're the kind of knowledgeless /fit/ parrot who would take my original statement and think I'm telling anybody to do crunches. Nobody said anything about crunches, you hapless clown.Do you sometimes watch them do kipping pull-ups and count "zero, zero, zero, yep still zero lunges"?i used to love deadlifts! I couldn't move the next day but gosh they we're an awesome lift, I'll definitely try incorporate them back into my routine.if your healthy enough to do a push up your healthy enough to do a barbell bench press or dumbbell bench press.

Start with 10 lb weights if you have to and slowly work up to heavier weights allowing muscle to develop and such.Now that I think about it again, they'd be screwed.

What do I do if I feel like the bar is slipping and I can't bring it down in a controlled fashion?Mmm, Crunch, I'd break my cut for a Crunch bar right now thoIt's more common then not to be freezing after major weight loss. It's due to the metabolic slowdown from the weight loss, and it is also a sign that the body is priming for weight gain. Take the body temperature first thing in the morning, if your under 98F your body is in hibernation mode. There are ways to get he body temperature up without weight gain -like sleeping a lot more, and intermittent training. FYI, The handful of people who loss 100 lbs and keep it off for over 5 years are the ones that successfully raise body temperature and restore thermoregulation to normal levels.The lengths people go to to skip leg day...your welcome man, share it if you think it can help somebody. 

I think many people are looking to fix this problemBobo is actually Mr. Popo? Confused.Can I just add on to this-it's also important to adjust your gait to match your breathing, not the other way around, otherwise you could end up hyperventilating."Anuda day; anuda lift" -Martin Luther KingI would say they downvoted him because randomly posting topless pictures of yourself is incredibly douchey.Eat more and lift, you still look like your making noob gains but it's alright man.

Drunk is definitely different from simply having some drinks. Trashed being an even more worse form of drunk.Leg press is good for your ego. Reflection sex? Never as satisfying as the real thing but still kind of awesome. I was once doing dips facing a giant mirror on a wall much further ahead of me. Between me and the mirror was this attractive lady doing bent over barbell rows. Since we happened to be lined up, our reflection looked like I was hittin her from behind. She didn't noticed until the guy she was lifting with came back from the water fountain and pointed it out to her. She just stepped to the side and continued her workout, not letting it distract her. The guy then gave me this "I'm going to rip your head off" look, knowing that I knew what I was doing. I've never done so many dips in my life.That sounds pretty freakin sweet. 
I just recently quit working at an LA fitness and I told everyone that the amount of old dude dick I saw weighed heavily on my decision. Not done making it out of noob gains aka untrained, sorry I'm on a s4 and typing on this shit is wierdI wasn't quite as active as you sound like you were, but I ran track in high school. After fucking up my knee and having to have cartilage removed, and being told that I shouldn't do...anything, come to think of it, my only real workout was some stupid bro split once or twice a week and biking to college.

So once I got a real people job, sitting at a desk and being handed cupcakes and donuts every other day, I was suddenly 215 pounds. I'm only 5'8", and to be fair, a lot of it was in my legs because of the running I used to do...but still. My libido was shot, my sleep schedule was screwed, my diet was horrendous, and I barely worked out anymore.

It's hard to change that. Good job on making it a priority. I like your  idea of only skipping if you've been on the job for 9+ hours. That's something I may adopt when I finally get a more lucrative gig and have to work 12 hour days.It was for me, it might not be for others.

I would have to say it depends on the nature of an individuals depression.

If one is depressed because they are sedentary and thier diet is shit, I would say yeah, exercise + changes in diet might do the trick.

If one is depressed because of some other reason, not so much.
http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1f1kqy/why_nobody_is_critiquing_your_workout_read_this/You don't think. "Coffee makes me shit a whole lot". So don't drink coffee or deal with it. What is the question here? Do you need to time your BCAAs properly so the coffee doesn't shoot them out your asshole and you won't be able to hit a 155lb squat PR next week? 

Caffeine and nicotine are known to produce bowel movements. It affects some more than others and generally stops doing it once you build up some tolerance. It's not like what you're shitting out is what you ate 10 minutes ago anyway. It was just hanging out in your colon.

It's okay man. We've all asked stupid questions before. That doesn't make you a stupid person. Just grow from this experience.Tolerance is a thing.Awesome, I'll try those out. Thanks! Best of luck on the date, I had good fun reading your post, so thanks for that :)Working through my DL warmup, did a single at 295, then put what I thought were 10s on the bar and struggled through 5 singles.

Those edits are pointless.I'm calling bull shit on this ok well you didn't even read my post then. i'm NOT skinny, and i never even said anything about not being able to afford a gym membership. i can afford a membership comfortably. the specifics i mentioned included being embarassed to exercise in front of others due to my lack of physical ability. i mentioned that im unsure how to use any of the machines and wouldnt want to make a fool of myself, i was asking this commumity how i should start getting in shape keeping in mind my situation. your wiki doesn't say anything about that. which i did read thoroughly by the way. i really don't think it's right that you removed this. My gym does; they look like goofs. Just do one or two compound movements.  

Squats and bench for example. 

Next day deadlift and ohp.

Etc....

You're not gonna be exhausted and you still gain a lot. 

But that way doesn't sound fun at all haha And im sitting here thinking i need to cut back a little after drinking 3 cupsYeah 5x5. I take 1m30sec rest between set.  I can be out of the gym after like 45minThe only thing missing is the blurb at the bottom saying the study was sponsored by Hostess Brands...Still not okay. In this scenario, he could have curled in literally any other space. On principle, he should have avoided the squat rack curl.Reading all these comments made me thankful for investing in building my own gym!Would you say since I'm training 5 days off one day that the descending carbs idea is probably best?Time outside in nature, regular exercise,  health diet, actively thinking positively and addressing negative thoughts. All of that helped me beat my depression.Eat a caloric deficit if you want to see those untrained abs or lift and eat below your tdee if you want to see trained abs.I don't have pro advice but, I am an ex-couch potato been going at it for 3 weeks, once you get started you start to really like, good for you for doing what your doing :)Or you could always do PHAT:

http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.htmlI'll tell you the same thing I tell everybody who asks this question:

The gym is not a foreign country. It's just a place. Behave like a normal person who has interacted with and shared a space with other people before and you will be fine.So here's my problem. I have two real passions in life.  American football and music. I play guitar myself, but I guess that doesn't count as training? (Even though I like to jump around my apartment playing through the whole "Songs for the Deaf" album by QoTSA) so then there's football. In my gym, the second best team in Sweden (Black Knights) is working out. I don't know if they got a discount or whatever, but since I'm overweight and my football knowledge is based on watching games and the fact that I'm pretty short is making me feel uncomfortable asking them for advice to join the team. Should I perhaps manage up the courage?This is a funny idea too :)Leg press is a bad comparison tool.  In any case, I'm 32/m/6'2/230. I lifted a bit when I was in my early 20s and again when I was 25, but it never lasted more than a few months, and my squat form was retarded. I've been at it for seven months this time. Squat is almost up to my bench lol

These are 5 rep max:

Squat: 215
Bench: 235
Deadlift: 315
Overhead press: 140When you can move furniture better than your dad.This submission has been removed.

Keep at it. We're all gonna make it brah.

Also, Army? Greetings from Ft. Stewart!I'm in PA. Sadly, it seems to be a trend with some locations. So theres this girl at my gym and my god the booty levels. This week, she had friends. Some very aesthetically pleasing friends. She makes leg day so much easier. how much do you squat?You don't. You mind your own business.Old dude at an Anytime Fitness left one of the two bathroom doors open while he was pooping and I was the only one who had the misfortune of making rigid eye contact with him. He looked so sad. I had to look up what 60kg was (in case anyone else doesn't know it's 1 plate), and that's awesome! Now you've hit 1 plate, you'll be wanting to hit 2!Thank you for the response! What is squat? and why are you doing it in the curl rack?please post pics so we can laugh at youLolstrong delt to arm ratioOh I kinda like this idea, but I'll say "if they're too heavy for you, I can put them away for you" (I'm a girl) Since you have a program to follow, the rest should be easy. Don't stress about what other people are doing, or thinking. Eye contact is fine, just don't stare too much, because it can be rude. Granted, everyone gets curious at times and watching people can be a good way to learn something new. 

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask someone for help. In my opinion, even if you are doing something wrong, most people won't tell you because they aren't sure how you will react. Many people don't want to hear your advice.. But that doesn't mean they don't want to give advice when asked. 

If someone does open their mouth and you haven't asked for it, just smile and say thanks. If it seems like legitimate advice ask for a second opinion or google it. 

Really, there's nothing to be too nervous about. Just go and do your thing. Gym time is your time. Make the best of it. 

TL;DR: ask questions when you need to. Worry about yourself, not what others are thinking. Also, be careful. Don't rush yourself and overdo it. Maybe your old gym just had lighter bars? i went from 137 (that's the lowest i measured myself. I might have been lower) to 220b in a bit less than 2 years. lots of muscle, bit of fat too. lots of calluses. lots of stretch marks - my skin literally burns after i do a few specific movements. but it love them! they are like battle wounds! i wouldn't give a shit about what others have to think of them! many girls actually love calluses. if you really don't like the stretch marks, i know many people suggest using cocoa butter - not just any type - but the ones prescribed for pregnant women as they use it on their tummy to avoid stretch marks. I have used it sometimes thought I don't use it anymore. From research taking fish oil pills daily help with stretch marks too.

as far as cutting, personally i won't suggest cutting any time soon - at least not for couple years. if you do cut, you might look more defined yes, but you will be much weaker and you won't look much different than someone else who hardly lifts. i would probably go with bulking for couple years straight - don't go for the complete dirty bulk - mostly lean with a few cheat meals here and there the day before your heavy workouts. Like i eat like a pig the day before squats and deadlift days. 

I would personally rather be big (muscle and bit of fat) than skinny aesthetic. being big and strong makes me feel a lot more confident. and it still looks like i lift even when i have my clothes on. It's got a ton of caffeine anhydrous. Its great, but all in all not the best for youFuck are you retarded? No wonder it's your first date.

I already lost 20.Nobody, and I mean nobody is mirin 285 or whatever. I really never felt knowledgeable enough to consider myself intermediate. I was still making somewhat linear progression on the squats and deads, bench had stalled a few months prior, and OHP? That seems to stall like every other week, heh. I was actually getting ready to look into more advanced techniques when I injured myself and was knocked out for a while.A couple weeks ago I took 2 scoops of Hyde but the guy who opens up the gym has a half hour late so I was sweating with an irregular spastic heartbeat in my car praying I didn't dieHe said mortals, not pre-birth genetically modified hulk mutantsI'm not taking my natural endowments for granted anymore.I can't seem to find a 1 inch diameter bar though since all I have is a bunch of 1 inch weights. Do they even make bars like that that are able to hold more than 250?I had a similar problem when I broke my pinky. Except I just didn't care and let my pinky heal without a buddy-strap or splint.

Personally I would recommend getting your pinky in a splint, and then gripping weights with everything except your pinky, that's basically what I did. Bend over rows were the hardest for me because my grip tended to give at the weights I was doing.34 male 5'10" 166lbs ~12% bf

Lunge I'm just imagining the saltiest old pirate man walking around giving fitness advice.I have terribly bad cognitive dissonance when this happens.  I know I shouldn't give pointers but goddamn if I see them injure themselves I'll feel responsible because I could have prevented it.

I just look away and focus even harder on whatever I'm doing.  The bad form will soon pass.Someone with more upper body muscle is going to have an easier time adding weight to bench. I train with some junior powerlifters with beast numbers on squat/dead, but they don't have the development for a huge bench yet.

You didn't state your height, so I can't say anything, but 150 lbs at 5'5" can be big, but it's underweight at 6ft tall. I'm speaking in terms of being strong.Would probably be your best bet.

The trapped air contributes to side stitches. If you focus on exhaling completely with each breath, you should easily be able to prevent or get rid of side stitches.I just joined a gym and I witnessed, for the first time, someone curling in the squat rack. And I now understand why that is annoying (the gym only has 2 racks). Not a great story, but there you go.Ask one of the guys working there to do you a routine, he/she'll most likely be bored and appreciate something to do!

Edit: Would this bar would be able to support 300 lbs? I didn't see anything on the page about weight capacityJust give her a compliment or something. When you see her, smile and nod. Ahh yeah I see what you mean, the more weight you can have on the palm of your hand as opposed to the fingers the better.I'm not a mortal by your standardsI don't think thats how it works :^)That is despicable. Do you think the guy on the machine heard what he said?I'm around the same as you a bit lighter though, 
17 Years old Male

Started lifting last year but due to injuries etc I stopped for half a year
Lifts(10Repsx3sets no breaks):
Bench: 115Lbs 
Squat: 120Lbs
Deadlift: 185LbsYou know, the three times I have said this, I felt bad after saying it because I was worried that some of the ladies at the front desk, who I am friends with, might hear me and think that I feel they are helpless or weak.  I rationalized that I was saving them from having to put up 500 pounds of weights just before closing. I would pay money though to see a woman say this to some bro-bohunk littering the weight room with weights and not picking them up.an enticing distraction to keep people away from the real prize: the squat rackThat would be hammered jaw. You'd need some sharp weights to get a chiseled jaw. he's the typical newbie who thinks he knows everything already. There is no actual time frame for SL, it ends when you can no longer make the linear gains. If that's the case feel free to switch it up, you can run separate programs for the different lifts if you are still making linear gains on the other lifts, you just have to be smart about the timing. 17/M/180 lbs
Only really just got back into lifting, sports had me out of the weightroom for four months
Bench: 135x5
Squat: 275x5
DL: 315x5
OHP: like 75x5 fuck shoulders and impingement

No other lifts really matter all that much unless you're olympic lifting, in which case snatch/clean and jerk would be significant, but leg press is basically jacking off with your legs so no one really cares.you're one of those newbies who think they've learned it all. Direct core work like hanging leg raises, ab wheel rollouts, planks and side planks will improve core strength on top of doing the compounds. Which will make you even stronger on the compounds.

Doing only the compounds only gets you so far. Later down the road for example, you will need to do direct tricep work, direct chest work, direct hamstring work and so on. 

The compounds are  a base, but there is much you can do on top of them. 

If you want to obtain a truly impressive deadlift and squat, avoiding direct core work will be your downfall. Could you recommend some stretches for a misaligned hip? Oh ok, I read somewhere that the ratio between losing weight and gaining muscles was controversial but the fact is that I'm trying to lose weight and at the same time training so my back/ shoulders won't hurt. I'm 23, I worked out in the field as a technician, service work, and I stayed basically the same regarding weight for 3 years. Now that I got a desk job back in October I hurt my back by doing nothing. Since I could base my work from anywhere I decided to work at home so I literally sat by my computer from 8am to 4pm and then just switched the HDMI cable to my comp and continued playing games and such. This really hurt my back, so I just wanna loose some weight and gain some back muscleI would be careful though loading these kinds of bars.
  
As you can tell this is sub optimal so seriously be careful when lifting with the bar loaded up.Thanks!  I'm not in the army though, close guess. Wtf is a ankle strap? Can you not just use the search bar for a belt? I work offshore on oil drilling ships and pull around 90 hrs a week. I wear a fitbit and during shift I'm around 20,000 steps and going up and down 150 flights of stairs a day in hot machinery spaces doing physically intense maintenance. That being said I feel your pain.

What made the difference for me is a pre workout drink and a concrete workout plan. Every other day no matter what I did on shift I drink a pre workout and go to the gym for 1.5 hrs. No matter what! Plus with drinking a pre workout you are forced to workout or else you will not sleep. A little incentive to step up the intensity. 

You can absolutely change your level of fitness. Come up with a plan of healthy food and workout plan then stick to it. You will be amazed what the human body is able to do. You will start longing for the gym as a way to keep your energy levels up during the day.  

There are people on this rig that have even more strenuous jobs than I do and they still hit the gym hard.

Stop mentally coming up with excuses and problems and come up with solutions. That's what worked for me.

YOU CAN CHANGE!I wouldn't say it's an alternative but definitely will help you 100%. I know when I'm mad I go for a run, as soon as I'm done I feel ten times happier than I did when I started.

Edit: Also you should check out /r/bodyweightfitness if you have limited equipment.Im pretty sure when you are going for your pr adding accessories will hinder you and cause you to plateau earlier.
  
But what do I know i'm just an idiot who lifts :^)The loltears, they are streaming, down this fayce. Yes, you will progress every time you squatYou fail to realize that direct core training makes your core STRONGER and larger. You seem to think that direct core work is for purely aesthetic reasons, that is dead wrong. &gt; My advice would be that Exercise is usually more important than diet

Not true at all. If you want to lose weight or gain muscle then you're going to have to make changes to your diet.Yeah, I figured as much. I might just end up saving up to buy a 2" bar and just buy some new weights too. Thanks for the helpOn the other hand you don't get all sweaty as soon as the first rays of summer sun shine on you.you don't even have a 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat, or 4 plate deadlift? LOL and you are telling people that they shouldn't do direct core work? What a joke. You are weak, learn some humility. I was really hungover for my 5+ squat day today, and wanted to forego my normal BBB sets. When I unloaded all three plates off one side, the other side pitched the barbell up, and if it hadn't caught on the underside of the squat rack hooks would have caused quite a commotion. As it is I looked like a moron, but apparently I've never unloaded the bar completely after a heavy set. :(An oz of muscle gain per week is not going to blow his weight class.  It's almost like he won't gain weight eating a maintenance diet even given any time constraint.Who here is discussing going for a PR? Most lifters will cut out accessory work maybe a week before programming for a PR week or a meet. But for the rest of their cycle accessory work is vital. 

Regardless, doing some moderate core work is not likely to hinder anybody. It isn't taxing on the CNS. Just like doing a few sets of curls a couple days before deadlifting is not likely to get in the way of your deadlifts. the antidepressant was strattera which is a norepinephrine inhibitor iirc. so the latter i think?M 22 at 230 pounds bench-320 deadlift-505 squat-375.

It's like asking whether a dumbell is good for anything -- yes, plenty.regular exercise *might* reduce your need for anti-depressants, although I would expect that in the short term you might well need to keep taking them to ensure that you feel well enough to exercise (depression can make it harder to get yourself to do whatever exercise you had been planning to do that day).


but its something to carefully monitor and discuss with your doctor.Just how much water are you drinking? I can get some pretty nasty cramps if I drink too much mid-workout.Yep shoulder injury made the smith my friend too.My understanding, based on the gym music I have been hearing lately, is that haters are going to hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.  Advice regarding the situation is pending.Well obviously, but I want opinions on what people think is best like what works for them I had no problem with flies, chest presses, curls, etc. The exercises that are compromised are the "pull" exercises that require a grip. I always wished they made a device that would attach to your wrist that would grip the weights for you, in case of finger injuries.Reppin 225lb deadlifts which is my new current working max, when some random dude gave me a thumbs up from the other side of the gym.

Your dick won't work quite right but you'll be happier."  More like 30-35 minutes! It was pretty great.Ask yourself these questions:

Everyone there is for a reason, give yourself one.My PPL is shit compared to yours. Over the years I've been focusing far too much on back and haven't given my chest the attention it needs.

Told him that and she looked at me and told "are you on gear?" "That's way to fast, you must be on gear". His face was priceless! Wow!!! Glad others are amazed at that 315 as well. I feel puny. I got up to 285 in 2 months of solid lifting and then realized I was chasing weight and sacrificing form. Now I'm down around 190 and trying to lock in form.

265lbs paused bench, 285lbs touch and go

Been lifting seriously for 9 months, but had some prior lifting experience.Like a discus throw in the Olympics, spin around once or twice then let loose.Damn man, that sucks that it happened to you. Don't let it get to you, you're doing this for yourself. I don't know if you lifted big numbers before, but if you didn't...remember that everyone starts somewhere. I remember starting to lift I started with the bar. Keep at it. Are you still on meds? I hate taking any kind of Meds if it is avoidable. God the potential side-effects with so many seem worse than the treatment for which it is ibtebdedI hate it. I hate when my workouts start losing steam because I worked too hard, so sometimes I'll put on my max and most of the time I'll fail and the fury of failure pushes me on to be better than even at the start of my workout.Definitely it will help. And it is quite possible that it could mean you could get off the meds. It looks like you're trying to use a URL shortener.

Squat: 335lbs(should be able to hit 355 easy)

Deadlift: 435lbs 

Can't bench press due to shoulder injury, when I could it was 275lbs. 

As for leg press it differs, but anywhere from 700-1100lbsFinally got my 500lb Squat on sunday.

Apparently i farted, no one heard it but my girlfriend behind me... she got it on video... and wont stop playing it over and over for me now. She finds it hilarious.Short answer yes, depending on the type of training you're doing there's a decent amount you can do to get stronger without gaining weight. If you're worried about the running portion do sprint intervals mixed with hill runs and tempo runs. If you're worried about the pull-ups work on my those going for speed. Keep your caloric intake below your TDEE. You won't be putting on weight other than the water fluctuations. If you want a longer more scientific answer I can provide one but this is really all you need to know. Thanks for the info. I just assumed they were the same because a couple articles compared which of the two were more effective.Remember to lift with through your heels not your toes.Honestly I'd suggest rack pulls with a shrug at the end, but that's just me. I know I used the smith a lot when I was recovering from my shoulder injury. Different strokes for different folks, as they say. The general rule of thumb is 3/4/5:

If you can bench 300, squat 400, deadlift 500, then you are a very strong human. You are not in the top 1% (or 10% for that matter) but all of these numbers are attainable for drug free, able bodied men (some women too but they fall into the God Tier category.)No rep unless everyone noticed. Looks good man keep it upi know antidepressants are more effective for the depression but for me taking medication like that has always been a "solve one problem, create two more" thing. so im hoping that a long term exercise routine would produce a comparable benefit without me having to worry about side effectsHey dudes!

Having muscle or joint problems aren't the same thing as "lack of strength". Gait and balance also aren't the same thing.

I just put out a new record on bicep curl on barbell that turned out to be 120 lbs, so I'm proud of that. I work on my biceps and arms a lot though, probably as much as everything else, so my other lifts aren't as good. I can bench the same on a good day, and squat 200 lbsI wrote it down for you in my list of questions. I will text an answer next Friday, or Saturday. I asked the doctor specifically about my situation for powerlifting. He laughed and said, no. It would drop my blood pressure too much. There are a lot of unknowns going on with me right now. He will know more when I see him next week. So, his answer to me would not apply to you.

I was operating under the assumption that he is new to bodyweight fitness. No one does a handstand pushup on their first day, no matter how strong they are, if they rarely ever do pushups to begin with. That's because BW workouts are a SKILL, not just about strength.Hmm, the doc gave you strattera for depression? That's odd. In the US (don't know your location) strattera is generally prescribed for ADD and ADHD, especially if you are taking something already for depression, like me. I take lexapro for the depression (which, like you, is all chemical imbalance.)

I have no side effects from the Lexapro, whereas I've had some from the strattera, especially before I figured out my dose. (I'm on a lower dose, so it's not as effective as it could be, but I don't have side effects like the jitters.)

My depression is not minor, so I'm comfortable taking a pill for it. I did the exercise treatment for awhile and it did work. Trouble is if I missed a day or two, then my depression came back worse. It was very hard for me to balance how much exercise I had to do and how frequently I had to do it in order to keep the depression in check. I can't guarantee I'll exercise every day for an hour and a half, but I can certainly take a pill everyday at the same time. But YMMV, especially since your depression is minor.

Good luck!Thanks, you describe the hallmarks of my heart; I could use to drop a few pounds, I have an apnea machine for when I sleep, and high blood pressure.It was the only area free of snow, so yesIt's different for everyone, but basically don't let your ego of being a "beginner" stop you from making the most of your beginner gains. If you've been lifting for years and years and your lifts are that strong, either you are training wrong or you really have maxed out your beginner gains. 

[Watch, or just listen to, this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfDpFyQsWaA) It really put me back in my place when I thought that I was no longer a beginner and I wanted to call myself intermediate. 

Then again, you can just ignore my advice and do what you think is right for you. Obviously I've never met you and never seen you lift so all or none of this could actually apply to you. Do what best fits your goals. This book is awesome.  TL;DR: it recommends 8 calories burned per lb of body weight per week.  Says it's like taking a little bit of Ritalin and a little bit of Prozac.I hear that it does help a lot. It certainly can't hurt! Maybe wean off the medication while exercising, under supervision of your doctor. 
I've recently started squatting everyday from just once a week and I started to get pain in my knees when I squat. Is this normal to feel some beginner pain.For many people that's a perfectly valid trade.Op already has a routine.http://www.builtlean.com/2013/05/14/whey-concentrate-vs-isolate-whats-the-difference/

not true.Calling that a squat machine makes me sad for all the gainz that were not gotten from a free barbell. Just tell him you're going to go do deadlifts if he doesn't want to do it then he doesn't have too. I don't feel like that should mess up a friendship.
Yeah, but not me, and not OP. That's why he's posting here. I hate that!  When they leave weights on a bar that's above eye level!

Lifting seriously for 6 months now

Bench: 225
Squat:340
Deadlift:365watched an old guy follow an employee out of the locker room explaining/complaining that the paper towels are all out in the bathroom. Employee is short and wide so i just saw him until he turned into the supply closet.  Old dude is now in the hallway to the locker rooms.  just him, his twig, his berries and the employee desperately digging for a roll of paper towel to get this guy out of the hallway.  There is old guy jimmy, and then there is old guy jimmy in the hallway in full view of most of the gym.  Me and my gym bag were the only thing blocking the view of him from the mom and three little girls heading into the women's locker roomThat's pretty damn beautiful.I was confused a little when you used leg press to measure your strength. Anyway here'a my numbers nothing special

Age: 25 Weight: 160lbs Height: 5'6
Squats: 330lbs x 3Bench: 293lb x 1 
Deadlift: 405lbs x 1

Just eat enough and you will be fine.My experience has been that Strattera is ok dealing with ADD but lousy dealing with depression. Lexapro doesn't do anything for ADD, but is great for depression and anxiety.

I have minor ADD and major depression, so if I had a choice, I'd give up the strattera but cold dead hand etc for the lexapro.

It's really difficult to find the one medication that works for you, so if strattera isn't working for you (or has too many side effects), talk to your doctor. Say, hey strattera does XYZ and doesn't do ABC. 

We're too early in this yet to really understand what the true causes are for depression, especially the obviously chemical imbalance cases. So there's a lot of guess work and crap shoots. In 50 years I predict we'll know far more than we know right now and we can just take a blood test that would reveal the right drug and dose, but until there's trial and error.I was told to try to split the floor with your feet when squatting, activates everything! If you want to improve your bench, bench more...How reliable is MFP for estimates of calories burned during exercise? 

I have a hunch its pretty liberal.You have never use leg press to do chest training? sounds novice. I have a hard time turning off when it's time for bed, I've gotten better at it since I cut out sugars and fatty food, soda etc. I try to drink as much water as possible, which it turns out might be the wrong thing to do cold turkey off of a life style of monster and soda, so I'm coming home from work right now and stopping at Wal-Mart to get some orange juice, Apple juice, and cranberry juice, as well as some Gatorade, the diet part is coming along pretty well, I'm staying away from eating as many starch foods (never realized how hard that was) and for the most part I'm seeing results, my weight isn't plummeting but I'm losing waist size, which could be building muscle/losing fat, but I want to move up to building a little more muscle and stamina so I don't get that mental and physical "I need a break" nagging in my head, I do take multivitamins, I started last November, and noticed a big change after a week so I stayed with it, I'm not really looking to turn heads or look like I'm going to pick up someone's car, I could honestly care less if anyone around me noticed what I've done up to this point, it's strictly about how I mentally feel about myself, and keeping my body keen and healthy, thank you for this list of things though I really appreciate your timeMy gym has 3 racks with bumpers and 2 with regular, the regular ones are in the busy part of the gym and the bumper plates are in the little Olympic training area that's usually pretty empty. You bet I squat bumper plates. woah pink floyd! Really? My trainer just told me I look fat.I don't know the exact answer to your question, but 2 miles a week sounds like very little running and Id be shocked if it had any effect on you. Just string a piece of fabric through the clip and tie it around your ankle in a square knot. Oh yeah I got this for sure, thank you for the encouragementIf its painless don't worry.  However there is no downside to stretching  and strengthening your rotator cuff to ensure that you maintain shoulder stability and prevent injuries as you continue your weight lifting program. Diet is one thing that I'd recommend you get right early. Eat more fruit and vegetables than you think is rational. Particularly leafy greens!

There's more to it than that of course and no doubt someone will reply to this saying words to that effect, but vegetables are great. I'm ex military, and yeah I'm 27, I appreciate your time, and your approach, thank you, and thank you for your service!315 (or 3 wheels) took me about 2 years as a 132lb runt. Pls weigh more than that ;-;Brokis snow trap shall not stop me from following the path of brodinIt couldn't hurt. Even if you phrase it "How would you suggest I start playing football?" (you know, but in Swedish) rather than "I'd like to join your team." I don't know how organized it is there, if they're short on numbers, they might be happy to have people to practice against, even if you don't suit up on game day. 

 I have friends in England that played Am. Football, and they were no great athletic specimens, maybe there's developmental side you could play with, or more of a social league. It seemed more accessible to play as an adult in England than in the US, really.

I didn't just go out and ride all those miles. I went on group rides and someone had to ride slower for me. I went on group rides and they just dropped me. It sucked at the time, but I it made me want to ride more and get better.

Also, try new things, you might find something else you love. 18 months ago my hobbies were craft beer and netflix. Now there's yoga mat in the corner and a pull up bar in the bathroom, I started both to get better at cycling. 
Then find a real gym Thank you for that.Pull ups are great, make sure you have a full grip and don't put your thumb over the top of the bar. Even a dead hang will be good.  If you want a fun way to work the grip without realizing it until later.  Find an indoor rock gym and try bouldering.  Otherwise, any barbell movement where you have to lift and hold the bar from the ground will help immensely.  If you can't do a body weight air squat you'd be better off losing weight than leg presses I get his reasoning in first part of the video, but the whole thing about external validation about myself and how strong or how good I look?

No, thanks.

Like you said, do what best fits your goals. Thanks for sharing.I think I qualify as an "average Joe," or at least what you might expect from a novice who is toeing the line of intermediate.

I'm 33, male, 239 lbs as of this morning. Working on losing body fat.  

I have been lifting for 2 years, but not consistently. On and off over the course of two years. Some of it was due to using tht time to train MMA, or just getting lazy, and also due to a torn ACL last year. I have been lifting *consistently* for about the last six months, but if I'm perfectly honest I had a few slip ups where I missed as much as a week or two within that time period, mostly due to my wedding and my honeymoon.  

Anyway, moving along, I don't really leg press. I do SL 5x5. I was doing SS when I first started lifting, but due to a knee injury I find the power clean to be very painful and I risk crippling myself if I do it. This may have changed over the past few months as the knee is a lot more stable these days.   

Moving along, I followed the program for a while and got my 5x5 squats up to 235, my bench up to 155, my press up to 115, my bb rows up to 165 and my deadlift up to 285. These are pretty close to my goals, but I decided to really focus on losing body fat and cut calories and carbs which made them drop like a rock and I cut everything in half and am steadily climbing back up hoping to lose enough body fat as I work my way back up that I can start gaining again once I get close to my top numbers.  

Leg press is not used as a measure of strength. I would suggest using more strength related exercises to get a good idea of your overall strength level, like "The Big 3" squat, bench and deadlift.

The app translates 500 calories for ever 1lb per week lost.

If they've set it to max allowed, without manual editing it, it's already shaved 1000 calories off their diet. If they're eating below that, they are in danger territory.

But I guess it depends on how large they are.

I have a buddy sitting at 6"2 and 420lbs, who started using it, and he's shucked almost 15lbs in a month. I could, we have a ymca here with great pools, I never thought of that, thank you!That is so sucky. I told the trainer that just did my free session that I'm happy with my body. And I guess my only goal is get stronger. I think he was shocked, but ran with it. I didn't want any stupid diet plans, so I was just forthright. 

I'd also like to think I impressed him with my guns! (Jk I'm a girl and I have no guns.) this has been my issue, I went from being unemployed going to the gym 6+ days a week.  to working 7 days a week 12+ hours a day. 

I lost a ton of weight, lost my muscle mass, then got fat. 

One thing I found was when I'm able to try to do squats/pushups/chin ups on breaks. People give me weird looks but I find it helps.  I also purchased some light weights that I keep under my desk. So on the off chance I'm waiting for something to load i lift some weights.  He doesn't coach Olympic weightlifting or even high level powerlifting as far as I know. He teaches football players the powerlifts.
Ah, hank hill syndrome. I would eat a lot while doing squats, deadlifts, and hip thrusters. it could be that they lightened-up the recipes because it looked so bad when they HAD to disclose the information.

Fuck yeah dude nice work Almost pooped my pants dead lifting on Tuesday (very scary)That's totally fair, like I said not all of it may apply to you. But I do think he's definitely right that many people throw away their beginner potential because they want so bad to call themselves intermediate. I have severe depression and no exercise does not help enough to replace medication. Sometimes it doesn't help much at all but I get a small sense of accomplishment. It beats sitting my ass on the couch all day. However, If you have mild depression then there is a chance it can help improve your mood.  I'm no doctor though, so get a professional opinion. Good luck!I always get the looks because I can only bench 135 lbs but can squat and deadlift 150 kg. Problem is, that's because I broke my collarbone 3 times.

Nailed itI failed my bench sets today on SL 5x5. I'm kind of disappointed because my last week's set was only 5lbs lighter and I got that with effort but not that much. Now my chest hurts on my upper right side. Ugh. What now. nah, on the salted sidewalk outside the gym, with the rock salt cutting into his palms.  I think that's up to you. I consider myself strong for me. I'm not nearly as strong as some of the guys here. There are guys who are smaller than me who can lift much heavier weight.  

But I can lift a lot more weight than anyone I know who doesn't go to the gym and I can lift a lot more weight than I could six months ago. It's really all about you and what your goals are.  

I set my goals at what a person should be able to lift at my goal body weight. I don't feel a need put up powerlifting numbers, just numbers that make me feel good and make me feel like I am accomplishing something.  
 
When I squat 2 plates, that's an accomplishment that makes me feel good. When I bench 155 for 5 reps, I remember when I was 17 and could barely bench 80 lbs. and it feels amazing to accomplish that.  

Don't compare yourself to the guy working out next to you at the gym.

This is what I picture.How many iron atoms is that bruhYeah I can definitely agree with putting your ego aside thing. They key to remember is that in order to build either muscle strength or size - for any movement or muscle - you need to be using a weight that is heavy enough to bring you to near failure on a single set of no more than about 12-15 reps.

If you're using a weight that allows you to completed more than 15 reps in a single set, you're building muscular endurance (mostly) and will not see any appreciable strength or size gains in the muscle. I benched one plate (45 lbs) for a 4 x 8 for the first time of my life. Was my goal when I first started one year ago.

Started working out again a month ago after stopping for 6 months.  Before that, only worked out for 6 months.

Dead lift: 110lbs

Squat: 100lbs

Bench: 50lbs.

I've definitely progressed.  All of those have doubled since I started last year, even with the stop.  I really wish I wouldn't have stopped. There was no real reason.You just reminded me of the Tony Little Gazelle commercials that were everywhere in the early 2000s. That hair...Impressive numbers, your squat seems to be very low compared to your other numbers tho.I was raised poor, I've worked my whole life, it's more of a life style than an actual choice for me, on my Sunday's off I don't even like sitting at the house, I have a hard time feeling accomplished or any self worth without knowing my family is financially stable and happy, my child works for everything he has, it's not hard work because he's very young, just helping put dishes in the dish washer, cleaning his room and helping his mommy fold clothes, but every Sunday he gets something that makes the week of work with it, and every month he gets a bigger toy, usually the week is a hotwheels car, and the month will be another hot wheels track, or an avengers toy, or a lego set, I literally can't turn off my work habit, it's effecting my life in more ways than I care to discuss, but I appreciate your concern truthfully, I don't know why you got down voted so much for caring about a stranger, but Im glad you do care for people even if you don't know themThis happened to me Tuesday evening and was kind of awkward/funny.

My gym was pretty full at that time and it was my leg day. There's 2 squat racks and 1 power rack but they were all in use with people waiting for them so I decided I'll just do my squats last. I then do my leg extensions. hamstring curls, calf raises and leg press. 

By the time I'm finished those exercises, the crowds at the racks were dying down. I then go up to a guy and ask how many sets he has left and he said he has 2. I said cool, backed away and then started looking around while whispering to myself. 

He then turned around and says "What the fuck?".
I then turned to him and was like "Huh, What?".
He then asked "Did you just call me a dickwad?"
I was confused for a bit and then realized what happened. I was talking to myself about what parts on my legs I worked on.
I was saying "Did quads, did calves, and did hammies."

Apparently, "did quads" sounded like "dickwad". I explained what happened and we both laughed. He finishes up his sets, we say later to each other, we fist bump and then I do my squats.OK. "This one weird trick" actually does work to get over stitches if you are just needing to gut through it.  I picked this up from my old platoon sergeant when prepping for selection a few months ago.  Flex your core for a few seconds hard whenever the pain gets to be too much.  It will buy some relief enough to get to another minute or two.   Rinse and repeat as needed.   Yeah, I watched Alan Thrall's deadlift video and have a couple ideas how to improve. I've done some preliminary checks with my approach and it should be better on the next DL day. The issue I think I'm running into is that my lower back even when I get set, shoulders back, chest forward, I have next to no lower back arch as hard as I try to force it. Either I have a super stiff spine, or my back fat absolutely overwhelms the shape of my back arch in appearance at this time. It's not pretty either way lol3/10Lol you have issues&gt;How much running is enough to lower testosterone?

Your source for this?I am progressing plenty on my lifts, minus bench. I have a lot of curls because my biceps are very weak (can barely curl 65) and small compared to the rest of my muscles. This routine is temporary, to add as much size as possible to my weak points before I start cutting in a month. I don't have a lot of leg volume besides calves, because hypertrophy there is fast for me.god, I envy this so much. My gym is also relatively small and not a chain. But, for some fucking reason, no one believes in using towels or wiping down. Honestly, I can't fault them too much since until I went to the gym at my university, I never really thought much about wiping down. But since my university gym had a strict policy of either you come in with a towel or you get the fuck out, I'm now really anal about that. It's just so annoying to come to the bench and see the outline of the prior user's head because of the sweat. 

Fuck. It makes me angry thinking about it. Even worse, a lot of times, people will do circuit training and act like I'm the ass hole for taking their equipment. Generally, I'm pretty calm and relaxed. But as soon as that happens, I just want to start talking shit to the gym. And this urge comes up even if the person is benching 400+ and is 6'4 (for reference, I'm only 5'4, and maxing out at 195). 

After writing all this out, I realized I should probably talk to management about this. I doubt they'll do shit other than post a sign up (which already exists) but eh. It's something, I guess. 
I'm not sure. I will definitely find out. I'm just worried about the balance of school + soccer + track&gt;Bobo see pretty girl... Bobo very thirsty.  
  
Sorry, but that's hilariously perfect.Assuming it is pure iron:

Bench: Approximately 1.294x10^27

Squat + Deadlift: Approximately 1.542x10^27 What? That is simply not true. I have been treated for depression in the UK and although exercise is encouraged it definitely isnt "the front line." Thats completely misleading. What kind of shoes are your running in? What kind of surface are you running on?

A poorly padded shoe combined with a hard running surface (e.g., concrete) can make for a pretty bad time for the calves. Sundays in general, if there's a big game on.  I don't know what game, I just know that it's a ghost town.Today's actually 3/7, but thank you. Im glad you were able to help.  My elderly neighbor fell between her bed and the wall.  No one came by to discover it for a week and she died even after being taken to the hospital.  Her younger friend lived with her and was gone on a trip.

Lifting for almost 9 years, although 4 years ago I injured my back which precluded me from lifting very heavy again until last summer or so. I still made sure to get in and lift what I could though the whole time.

Estimated maxes from a few weeks ago (doing a powerlifting meet at the end of the month so I had to feel out what I was capable of, should be fairly accurate)

It sounds brutal. I'd put a few years in first. 131 amigo. Kidding. 230. good for you man. My gym doesn't have a squat rack, so the only times I ever do them are at my school gym. I still do legs but instead of squats I usually settle for leg press. Also keep in mind I can do 5 reps of 225lbs, I've never tried a 1rm for squats.ya I get that, but I did not know before. I'm pretty hot, if that's what you're asking. ;DHmm...doesn't sound too excessive, but not the amount of water I would drink normally. Usually I just drink a little from a water fountain if I feel really thirsty (which doesn't happen until about an hour in or so). Maybe try that for a day and see how it goes?20/M/150/1.5 years

Just tested my maxes for a new program I just started. Doing my first powerlifting meet in a little less than 6 months with a goal of 1k.Hahaha I thought you called meI saw the swole guy at the gym checking out either my squat depth or my ass.  I'm not sure which.  Definitely one of the two.I'm sure you know this but it helps to read it in words.

In a male dominated industrial environment that we work in, respect is everything. There is a lot of "fat hate" in our society and there is not a lot of respect someone who is out of shape. If you are a female the road is that much tougher. It doesn't make it right, but unfortunately it happens alot. 

This plays into promotions. In order to reach the supervisor positions where you are not breaking your back day in and day out and working crazy hours people need to be able to respect you and the decisions you make. I know a lot more is at play like job performance and leadership skills, but physical appearance does matter. 

For example on this rig there is a supervisor that is very over weight. He does a good job, but his physical appearance degrades his performance as a leader. He has to make decisions that are sometimes unpopular and people slight him behind his back because of his weight. He makes the right decisions, but they are not respected. Its a tough thing to watch. really really cheap "no brand" plates.

I'm currently forced to work out it the shittiest shit hole in the city I'm at and I've learned the hard way that "20kg" is a *really* loose term.

Yesterday I weight 1 "20 kg" plate at 27kg.Try it for a month or two, it helped my father. You can also try the exercises in "Naked Warrior" by Pavel, it methodologies are quite different and I personally noticed a considerable difference in my strength.If it's free, I'd give theirs a try if they seem educated! always cool to have an outsiders opinion. Pretty sure people can drastically reduce squat ROM and give an artificially big number tooYou've gotta check out the Brosciencelife channel if you haven't already. I was swimming laps at my family center this morning, and there are some special needs kids/adults that come in with a camp to swim. They're all very friendly and sweet people. In the middle of my 400, this old lady came up to me and said "Those people (referring to the special needs group) have NO business being here. They are an absolute disgrace." Her friends were bitching about it as well. I just about exploded right there and reported it to the management. The lady and a few of her friends ended up getting their memberships suspended. 
**JUSTICE PORN**27/m/275 lifting 6 months

big three:  bench/squat/deadlift +OHP extra

255/455/425 + 165 OHPI'd do it if I knew they knew what they were doing.Yeah it is a thing. Practicing the jerk. Targets a much different area as the jump helps provide the leg drive to hoist the weight up. The arms do not do nearly as much pushing as with an OHP. It's a lot more technique than our strengthI'm a puny novice, been lifting for about 3 months. I'm at 140 bench at 5x5, 230 deadlift 1x5, and I'm fucking around with 100lb front squats because I've had to deload a million times trying to fix my form but oh well lolGotta remember that butt plug next time mate! the white kind i had until it crumbled and fell off the stick hit the locker room floor and shattered....It also helps if you shave your armpitsThat's a good question!  

I *think* (correct me if I'm wrong) that mfp uses the Harris-Benedict equation to figure out your calories.   

There are other equations you can use to figure out your calories. The MFP one always worked pretty well for me, but these days I customize my goals and use Katch-McArdle.If you have Nike Air's, those are closer to a minimalist shoe in terms of running. I would HIGHLY suggest getting a shoe made for road running. Going to a sport store (or a store that specializes in running) will be your best option.who cares? you have a tiny dick? you think i'm impressed by people moving weights? i barely workout and i've deadlifted 315lb. i never deadlift because it destroys your back.I forsee a marriage in the future - congratulations.I've worked out at a lot of different gyms and there is something about the Y that makes old people just want to hang dong in the locker room for unnecessarily long amounts of time. There was this old dude at the Y I use to work out at that would take a shower, then dry off, then put on his socks, then go shave...while only wearing his socks.I've had similar issues with the white kind. They make it in another variant that is like turquoise/blue colored stick instead of the white stick that I've used for years. I buy them in bulk sometimes and they are good for months on end. Highly recommend. They're not Nike Airs but they're a similar shape!

I'm not sure how long to put since I didn't lift for 2 years and got back into it this past yearIf normal squats don't bother you, you could just replace it with that. I am loathe to give advice though because the whole rule 5 rig-a-ma-roll. yesJust speaking from personal experience, yes and no. The biggest reason I started a serious workout and weight-lifting regimen about a year ago was to fight depression. It made a lot of difference (as does any healthy lifestyle change) but it isn't a silver bullet. I still have periods of time where I am very depressed- and I'm still looking for that silver bullet because it seems like no matter what you do it will still be there a little bit- but it is TOTALLY 100% worth adding exercise of whatever variety (whatever you enjoy that makes you feel good) to your anti-depression plan.It takes me 1 minute to walk there and costs me $30 a semester. 
But still... Gym story Saturday is somewhat about complaining. If they both eat at the same calorie surplus over their (respective) TDEEs they would gain roughly the same amount of weight. Whether it's mentally *easier* for a tall guy to do I'm not sure, but it's certainly achievable for both. As for whether the tall guy can put on more muscle/week than a short guy, I haven't seen any research done on that. In general, research on muscle gain and stuff like that seems to be pretty far behind questions like this (i.e. it's still not totally settled what the maximum natural muscle gain over time is, let alone finding how height affects this). I think funding in this area just isn't there.If you want both, go for low reps, but high sets and volume. The low reps will allow you to go heavy and build strength, while the high volume will allow you to build size. Take long rest periods so you can keep hitting heavy weight.36 Male 6'5" 208lbs lifting for 1 year

For me it was a rather simple operation and I was all fixed after that; no medications since.  However, if it's medications that you'll need in order to keep your heart working, the benefits will far outweigh any side effects.Ah, interesting! Obviously I'd never seen it before as a distinct exercise. Makes sense that it would target different areas too.I used the smith machine to squat yesterday. I will no longer be using the smith machine.Yeah pretty much. Squat in the 5's, only leg press in the 7's.

Where are you from? I think most people here just go to the grocery store and pick up whatever is already packaged on display. At least that's what I do. I would like some free soup bones once in a while...I don't know how long you have been lifting/what your goals are but you could easily find a currently accepted/working program and modify it to suit your needs with little work. Or if you are feeling ambitious you can take that 50 bucks and look around and find a textbook or two on program design and do it yourself and forever have that knowledge for the future. Leg press is for pussies opWhy? Is that assist?I'm going to answer with a definitive no. I'm on antidepressants and I know I clearly need then. I go for a run most mornings, usually 4-5 miles and that helps clear my head, but the effect isn't very long lasting. Some mornings, I even need to pop a Xanax to keep my heart from racing during my run, depending on how bad the anxiety and depression are when I wake up in the morning. I guess I do have a few questions about it:

How do you like benching in it (Assuming you do)? I hope the 2" spacing is good enough to get full range of motion.

For the chin up bar, knurling doesn't bother me much; but does the cage sway around much when using it? 

The only thing that prevented me from jumping on it was the relatively low weight of 107 lbs compared to other cages; I thought it might not be as sturdy. It should be good for sub-300lb lifts, right?Great things to have, main item in my home gym. Also have free weights but still really use the smith machine primarily.Pretty impressive for one year. Were you lighter than 175 when you began lifting?That's my gym, too! 
It's not great by any stretch of the imagination but having a gym that's close to work is great. I don't have an excuse to skip the gym. Vitamin shoppe having 20% off very soonhttp://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/09/13/low-serotonin-levels-dont-cause-depression/

feel free to examine the many other sources on googleMake it a barbell thrown like a javelinYes we did. Everything was power related. We never did full cleans, but I never deadlifted until I started training for powerlifting. As a result I use a lot of back when deadlifting which isn't optimal. Always benched, although never paused like in powerlifting. Squats were always there but never to a proper depth, usually performed with boxes underneath us. The foundation was set from football. There's no way I could've totaled what I did without it. I hate people who leave out the "I've been lifting since I was 12" part in these posts. Am in scotlandWhy use imperial for height and metric for weight. But anyways congratz :)This is hilariously flattering.I wouldn't be surprised if that woman was a new employee from the new year.Is that the brand name? Seems like an odd thing to call orange concentrate.Actually, I've gone to several gyms now in different cities and this seems to be common. 
There's always that older Asian guy that works out in non-gym attire, early in the morning, and usually without any regard for any proper form. 

For what it's worth, when I worked in south Korea, based on my experience at only one gym, it's socially unacceptable to go in anything other than proper gym attire. I just don't understand why anyone would make fun of someone who's at the gym. Even if all you can lift is five pounds you're still stinger than anyone who doesn't make any attempt to better themselves. Stay strong buddy. I threw him, I didn't drop him, climb off your high horseThere is no "average" lifter to compare yourself to. Don't compare yourself to another man, compare yourself to your former self. 

Just strive for progression. 

My progressive goals are something like this:

1 plate bench --&gt; 2 plate squat --&gt; 1xBW bench --&gt;3 plate deadlift --&gt; 300lb squat --&gt; 2 plate bench --&gt; 2/3/4 plate bench/squat/dead --&gt; 1,000lb club --&gt; ????

I've been at it one year and am half way through the progression. Others would be done with this in a year. Still others might achieve them in a different order. And still others might only have accomplished one or two of these goals in a year. None of that matters as long as you see consistent progression.

I, personally, believe that it is. However, when you're depressed, it's much much MUCH harder to work up enough motivation to go to the gym - and continue it consistently - than it is to just pop a pill. (Hence the state of the US's healthcare woes, etc.)Based on the bit of info you gave, it sounds like you're going to give $50 to somebody to write you up a bro-split that won't be fundamentally any different than some shit you pick up off bodybuilding.com. Bro, before you ask how much mortals lift, you must ask "do they even?"Look, it was worth it for me. But I use anti-d's as a bandaid: three months on when I'm at my worst is enough of a boost to get the rest of my life choices back in order. Works for me. I can deal with no orgasms for that long (though the gf is not a fan), while I get exercising again and better sleeping patterns and working on CBT properly once more.

You'd probably get in a lot of trouble for it. Powders in envelopes make people nervous.I usually do a scoop of chocolate protein with my cup in the morning if I'm running late.

That being said, I'd talk to him too, but in front of management. Oorah future devil. My best advice is worry about running now. Pull ups will come in boot camp. Worry about running now. Find a heavy back pack. Load it up with weight and walk up the tredmil with as much incline as you can go. This will help a lot in the hikes especially at soi. Trust me you don't want to be too big when you get to boot camp. That's the mistake I made This happens to me so badly that I wake up at least once a night from it, sometimes multiple times.

(If you're landing on you heels. You'll start developing knee pain. To the point were you were off ligaments* if they arent well adapted do to inactivity. )
Though it may just be your legs adapting to the running. Specially if all the running you've done is on a treadmill. Which is worse.

Sure it hurt like hell ( i had my calves and internal tibia ligament ware if with tares after running to much.) Made me wanna cry for a whole two weeks.
Let them heal if that happens.

But for calves get a jump rope (or a multi speed bicycle) that will help your legs.

Do your workout consist of just upper body. Or do you also do squats. Maybe its just that you have not paid much attention to your legs as much as your "abs".

Consult a doctor if it continues. If not try running on different surfaces. ( run uphill, dirt, gravel, beach sand, a school track.) Try a jump rope aswell. If not cool of till they heal.Rah devil but I'm already at soi W hikes were never hard (probly a side affect of the weight loss) and I was like 160 at my lightest in boot I'm stuck in guard till itb picks up and I'm doing research to see what I should do when I hit the fleet and can work out.

I know they were talking about way longer than 2 or 3 miles a week, but I'm curious if ANY type of endurance training has a negative effect on Testosterone.

I decided it would be best to use the church by her house since it's the same chain and is a lot closer than the hour drive to my house. I get in and all I see is people hogging up machines, leaving everything on the floor, and overall it was a shitty experience. I completed my entire workout of shoulders + arms for accessories using the low back seat and I was even able to squeeze in my three sets of tricep pushdowns.

I started lifting seriously in November, so I've been at it for about four months.Practice engaging your glutes first! Squeeze your cheeks as you walk around during the day, both at the same time and individually. Glute bridges, hip thrusts, and other exercises won't help you if your glutes are so under-active that you can't fire them yourself. They'll only serve to increase your muscular imbalances because your hamstrings and other leg muscles will take over. I'll never understand why people think heavy warm ups mean anything.  I haven't worked out consistently for some time now due to a heavy course load, but I've kept most of my strength.  I got done squatting sets of 8 with 275, and was unloading the weight when the next guy up says to leave it.  I ask him why he's not doing warmups and he gets this mildly cocky tone and says *this is my warm up*.  Oh, does that make you feel better?  You feel like a big man you little shit?!  I could warm up with that too but I'm not retarded.  It doesn't make you look strong to have a heavy warmup, it makes you look stupid; it's not something to take pride in.It eventually cleared his time, so they went by the timers stopwatches.

I'm inclined to agree with you on this, just wanted to see what the community's opinion on this was.Get fitted for a proper running shoe by someone that knows what they're doing. It makes a huge difference. I drink my apple cider vinegar with 2 tbsp of lemon juice, 1 tbsp of RAW honey, and 1 tbsp of cinnamon.

Even if they're not sure what causes it, how in the world does that justify you saying that clinical depression doesn't exist? Also, how do you explain the fact that medication is effective for thousands upon thousands of people? Somebody that I used to know!!!That makes a lot of sense to think of the dead lift as a 1 set max. I only increased my weight a bit from when I was doing 3x12.

I just kept pushing myself and started to notice I kept trying harder and my lifts went up a bit and I just generally felt like I got a better lift in. Although my major lifts didn't go up a crazy amount, I still went up a bit and it just felt better. Thanks for the sound advice.You have nothing to worry about, as long as you're getting rest and lifting. Cardio doesn't become catabolic until your running for extended periods of time every day. Some people are even fine doing that.  However, if the goal is to get big and strong then HIIT is a much better option. 10 minutes of hill sprints twice a week will be less wear and tear on your joints, and will promote muscle growth better.

In the states we dont even suggest it most of the time we just jump straight into pharmaceuticals.Who cares what people who go to commercial gyms think?

Dont argument ad polulum. Respect yourself And now you do know, which was the reason I responded.Nah thats just what we tell novices so they dont get self conscious. Everyone is watching, everyone is judging. I superset judging, looking at girls and drinking water between setsAnytime anyone asks me what I lift I always say:

"Well that depends, how much does your mom weigh?"I was trying to focus right before a dumbbell press, the minute I got on my back the bro next to me slams his 120lb on the floor after his set making a loud shattering BANG. As annoying as it is, I had the urge to tell him if he can't  put his weights down normally he should go lighter.
Thats why we have competitions with judges NoIn truth, you can't.

You were born and developed a set number of muscle fibers in that region. You can only hypertrophy those fibers so much. You might experience some degree of hyperplasia. 5-10% increase in fiber number has been hypothesized in elite body builders and animal models. But for the former to be maxed out, or the latter to potentially occur, you need to train 15+ hours/week. Plus eat perfectly, supplement and maybe take some help from the roids.

I'm not saying you can't get some gains. I also don't know how little muscle mass you really have at the moment. But the potential for hypertrophy is at the end of the day limited by the number of fibers you have to begin with. For some things, you've just gotta pick your parents well.I read a study that showed that therapy+exercise showed better results for treating depression than therapy+antidepressants or exercise+antidepressants with no therapy. I'll do my damndest to find a link but I haven't been able to so far.Rock on dude, I'm actually from Akron.Rookie here, why "never milk"? Because I sometimes milk. 
Give up on the rubbish food for starts. (Soda pop, and chips) Eat healthier. (Does not mean your diet will consist of one salad a day. ) do not starve your self.

Start off with something light to get into some form of condition. (Like running, getting a multi speed bycicle, a jump rope)

Then after a week or two. Improve in it if you want to do light weight lifting. Having someone help you out with form. (Bodyweight exersises, then some light weights.)

Some simple movements that will help would be doing squats (lots of squats) Deadlifts (not to heavy, work on form first.) Overhead press. Or even bench pressing. Pull ups. Who know the list can go on.

But in general Squats, deadlifts, bench press would be one way to start. After or before a run.

If you ask your parents if they can help you invest on a decent 5 ft. Barbell with a set of 80-110lb weights. That can run you for $60-80 dollars (US).
Even getting you started with a marcy bench press for $100. a jump rope, and a bicycle can get you pretty far from were you are at now. (Unless processional equipment is on your budget)

Though first check out the wiki. Or doing the Strong lifts 5×5 program work. (Start with body weights, then go up to 10lb, for a couple of days, then 20lb, --- up to 50lb. Once your are able to handle that weight for a month or two. It would be up to you if you want to increase the weights beyond that. But i would highly recommend starting light and work on your body' imbalances. Before going overboard.


Conclusion: start with a jog-run. 
(2-3miles a day) maybe more after you get used to it.

5×5 program. (Body weight, then increase weight slowly.) Get some help from a buddy or even a parent.

A jump rope or multi speed bike would help if you have those. Or even a local gym.



Though it's hard to get a program fit for you with the info provided. (Which is good.) Look around the web. First. Still though start with running as in tomorrow or even today.I've been lifting for 4 months and was going to start PHAT this monday.. Is this highly unadvised?I can't get my head around this. Wtf?

http://i.imgur.com/V84Hqhz.jpgThe injury is my finger so I wanted her help to give me a routine that avoided me grabbing things. I didn't want to stop training because I can't grab anything. Yeah and I eat beef but I wouldn't eat human meat, what's your point? 

Just because humans are animals doesn't mean that we should just pretend like we don't find it disgusting. That's a natural instinctual reaction.So the other day I see this overweight guy doing one arm dumbell rows only he's not,  he's doing this half shrug half jerking motion to get the dumbell to move maybe a few inches.

I see people doing lifts wrong all the time but for some reason I decided that was it, I was literally upset at how terrible his form was. So I approached after he finished his "set" and asked if I could give him some advice. He literally said nothing and just stared at me, so I decided to just give it to him anyway. I pointed out what he was doing wrong and showed him proper form. He seemed to be listening intently but when I finished he simply said "good to know" in an annoyed tone and just walked out. Wtf.

Keep in mind, this dude is weak and fat (he was also wearing gloves, uhg). I'm strong and fit. I have a gay porn stars body, and this dude acted pissed that I'd have the audacity to correct his form. WTF.


Tldr: tried to help a fat weakling with his form, he acted like I called him a fat weakling. Why doesn't anyone want help?????I think it's a British thing. You don't want to be wearing boxers when doing power cleans.You won't be able to do it in the beginning. As long as you have that mindset and don't beat yourself up too much for failing the program for the first couple times then go ahead. Lifting for 4 months means you'll still be getting 'noob gains' (pro bro science), so really there's no point. Stick to the simple compound exercises with a few isolation exercises and you'll be grand (pro bro science 2)A better solution would be to buy an olympic bar instead of this shitty one, and you will never have to worry about how much weight it can hold.M/32/100kg

Hope that's not too much information It's better with milk.

Also, is not necessary a blender, with a simple shaker you're done. Unless you used fruits.hold up yourself, arms extended, then go down as slowly as possible.  repeat. soon enough you'll be able to do one.I would. It trust a 1" bar with 300And you felt the need to start a new thread for this random question....why don't you wait until Monday and contact the manufacturer directly?I do 84 hours a week.IDK man, I've been lifting on and off for two years and it intimidates me. I'm sure there are people here who can better answer this question than I can, but it looks like something you want to put some time in before you do.Disagree, your core is such a fundamental prt of most major lifts that you can definitely dedicate serious time to it. I have done a full yoga class along with a big core circuit for a full core workout before and it's fucking awesomeMoney's a bit tight unfortunately. If that weren't the case I would spring for [this](http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=10793623&amp;clickid=prod_cs&amp;recid=Product_PageElement_product_rr_2_966) set and be done with it. But again, not that simple.Um bro. I'm not saying that's what's getting me out of bed in the morning but they fucking know you can pause 9 plates on the leg press. Whether or not they go, "OMG HE STRONK" is beside my point. They know and care enough to retain that memory.Cringeworthy...you should get off the internet moreThis submission has been removed.

I'm sure you could find a legitimate Olympic barbell used for a similar price.&gt;...any suggestions for a beginner starting at a young age?

FAQ mate -----&gt;I'm not the op, but I also have the rack. 


The holes are perfect for me on any lift and the j hooks are shallow enough for easy lift off


There are two pegs for plates at the back of the rack which help prevent swaying during chin ups / pull ups and I've had no problem with slamming 300~ after squats into the hooks. Pretty sturdy for its frame and price imo I'm looking for a rack so I can start SL too! Probably going to go with the Titan non hd. Seems to be pretty good for a beginner like me and in my budget. Good luck!It's alright, homie. 

But I've seen this guy before and he doesn't re-rack his weights. So I'm not willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.Not very constructive, but okay.For biking it was about 300 over what my garmin+hrm gave me.

Having muscle problems isn't the same thing as lack of strength?

You seem to be completely ignoring my primary citation. I have no idea why you're so intent on saying strength isn't important in the elderly, but I no longer care.Well, I'm sorry that you find perfectly normal human biological processes disgusting.

Wow this is strange, I was just starting to look up more videos to understand leg drive yesterday. Now this comes up, awesomeCardio improves interset recovery,  and depending on how many reps you're doing, interrep recovery. Your anaerobic system simply isn't designed to do 20 high intensity squats. Or even 8.

If you aren't doing cardio you are potentially robbing yourself of future gains.

http://www.strengtheory.com/avoiding-cardio-could-be-holding-you-back/

Anecdotal: when I started cardio I was stalling pretty hard on a number of lifts. As my cardio has improved, my gym time has gone down and my numbers up. As a severe example, I could not rep anything above 90% on deadlifts. Now I can hit 455 for 5 reps (&lt;8s rest) with a 500 lbs working max, whereas when 455 was my max, I was having trouble getting 3 reps at 405 without 8+ seconds between reps.When I was losing weight I used low calorie jello. Every time I went to the kitchen I grabbed one and walked out.This doesn't make sense. What's an aerobic routine aside from some form of repetitive endurance exerciser?Your dad has some good points. You'll love the ease and convenience of having your own personal gym but a part of you will be wanting to show off your gains, especially strength I imagine. I'd just stick with the gym honestly. In a perfect world you'd have enough money to have both, and just use whichever you feel like on a given day, but oh well.if your previous approaches were not bulks (as your phrasing has led me to believe) that is exactly the reason you stopped making progress in your lifts.Never heard of itStop being a wuss and just go work out.
