# RedditRaspberry
Data collection project for the raspberry pi

I am addicted to the Reddit API, specifically the Python wrapper:

I had a Raspberry Pi, so I thought I would gather some Reddit comments and tinker with this amazing word cloud generator:

The sort of sequel to this project is in another repo, GuessThatSubreddit.
